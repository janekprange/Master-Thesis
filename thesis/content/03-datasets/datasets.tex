\section{Stack Exchange Dataset}%
\label{sec:datasets:stackex}

\begin{itemize}
  \item main dataset used in this thesis
  \item taken from Stack Exchange\footnote{\url{https://stackexchange.com/}}, a network of online Q\&A forums
        % TODO: @chatgpt describe stack exchange further, similar to the description of reddit in the askx dataset
  \item the focus was on forums that focus on a specific group of people, like \url{https://biology.stackexchange.com/} for biologists
  \item only what/how/why questions are used to ensure that there was an actual explanation of a concept in the answer
  \item \num{16} group-specific forums where identified
  \item \num{11} of these where used for the experiments
  \item the selected groups and the number of answers used can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:datasets:stackex}
\end{itemize}

\section{AskX Dataset}%
\label{sec:datasets:askx}
% compare https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03876
\begin{itemize}
  \item The corpus is derived from Reddit\footnote{\url{https://www.reddit.com/}}, an online discussion forum where users publicly post messages and others post responses.
  \item Reddit is organized into subreddits, each focused on a specific topic.
  \item Each subreddit has its own posting rules and moderators who enforce them.
  \item The focus is on a specific kind of subreddit that follows the \enquote{AskX} schema.
  \item Examples of such subreddits include \enquote{Askelectricians} and \enquote{Askteens}.
  \item In these subreddits, anyone can ask a question, but only members of the specified demographic should answer.
  \item For instance, in \enquote{Askelectricians}, only electricians should respond to questions.
  \item A total of \num{26} subreddits following the AskX schema were identified.
  \item From these, \num{24} subreddits were manually selected and grouped together to derive the corpus, as can be seen in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:datasets:askx}
  \item similar subreddits had to be manually grouped together because there were too few answers in some of them
  \item only what/how/why questions are used to ensure that there was an actual explanation of a concept in the answer
\end{itemize}



\section{Steering Dataset}%
\label{sec:datasets:steering}
\begin{itemize}
  % TODO: continue
  \item questions taken from \citet{petroni-etal-2021-kilt,rooeinKnowYourAudience2023}
  \item details in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:datasets}
\end{itemize}
