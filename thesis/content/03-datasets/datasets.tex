\section{AskX Dataset}%
\label{sec:datasets:askx}
% We derive this corpus from Reddit, an online discussion forum in which users publicly post messages to which other users post responses. Reddit is structured into subreddits, each of which focuses on a specific topic, has subreddit-specific posting rules, and subredditspecific moderators that enforce these rules. We consider a specific kind of subreddit that follows the "AskX" schema. Examples of such subreddits are "AskAGerman" and "AskAnAmerican". As per the rules of these subreddits, anyone can ask a question, but only members of the specific demographic should answer these questions. So, in "AskAGerman", all answers should be written by German nationals. We identified 91 subreddits that follow the AskX schema. From these, we manually selected 13 AskX subreddits from which to derive a corpus (see Table 1).
