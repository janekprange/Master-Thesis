\section{Datasets}
\label{sec:appendix:datasets}
For the experiments conducted in this thesis, group-specific answers from different sources have been utilized, as described in Section~\ref{sec:datasets}. These answers were divided into training, validation, and test sets to fine-tune various models. Within each of these splits, the groups were represented equally to ensure balanced training and evaluation conditions.

\begin{tabular}{llSS}
  \toprule
  {Purpose}             & {Dataset}      & {Number of Answers} & {Answers per Group} \\
  \midrule

\end{tabular}

In addition to the datasets used for training and evaluation, a total of \num{400} questions were employed in the steering experiments, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:datasets:steering}. Of these questions, \num{320} were sourced from the work of \citet{petroni-etal-2021-kilt}, while the remaining \num{80} questions were taken from the work of \citet{rooeinKnowYourAudience2023}.

\subsection{Reddit (AskX)}
\label{sec:appendix:datasets:askx}
The following table presents an overview of the Subreddits from which the answers used for the experiments in this thesis were sourced. It also includes information on the number of answers to what/how/why question extracted from each Subreddit. Furthermore, the table illustrates how the Subreddits were grouped. Finally, it specifies the number of answers that were actually utilized in the experiments.

\section{Prompts for Attribute Sentence Generation}
The following prompts are used to create the synthetic dataset (see Section~\ref{sec:approach:attributeSentenceGeneration}). Many of the prompts have been taken from the work of \citet{patelLearningInterpretableStyle2023} with the notable exception of the knowledge prompts, which are part of the extension to existing approach presented in this thesis.

\subsection{Open-ended Style Prompts}

\end{description}

\subsection{Targeted Style Prompts}
\label{sec:appendix:targetPrompts}

In this thesis, the following template for the targeted style prompts are being used:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Write a description about the usage of '{{feature_name}}' by the author of the following passage. If it is used by the author write a long description, otherwise keep the answer short.
  Passage: {{passage}}
  Description:
\end{lstlisting}

For each of the following targeted features, the \textit{feature\_name} is substituted by the feature name. The list of features follows the work of \citet{patelLearningInterpretableStyle2023} with the exception that \enquote{swear words} is not included twice and \enquote{male pronouns} as well as \enquote{female pronouns} have been removed because the resulting attribute sentences are two similar to each other. Because of the high similarity, the attributes were often in the same clusters even though they were describing different genders.
