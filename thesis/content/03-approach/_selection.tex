\section{Selecting the Style Vector Attributes}
\label{sec:approach:selection}

\begin{itemize}
  \item the vector has 768 dimensions, the attributes are selected automatically
  \item a attribute may only be used in a maximum of \SI{60}{\percent} of the groups
        \begin{itemize}
          \item otherwise it is not well suited to distinguish between the groups
        \end{itemize}
  \item often, the same attribute was used multiple times to describe the same input text
        \begin{itemize}
          \item multiple prompts produce the same attribute
          \item if one prompt produces one attribute multiple times, it is only saved one time
          \item for further computation, only unique attributes are used
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
