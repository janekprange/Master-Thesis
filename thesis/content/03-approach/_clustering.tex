\subsection{Clustering}

\begin{itemize}
  \item often, style sentences are generated that are very similar
  \item e.g. \enquote{The author uses short and concise sentences.} and \enquote{The author uses concise and short sentences.}
  \item If one style sentence is used very often but in many different variations, it may not get selected for the style sentence vector because each variation by itself has not occured often enough
  \item The sentences are embedded with the model x % TODO: write that here?
  \item because of that, all style sentences are clustered so that sentences which embeddings have a cosine distance of less than 0.15 count as the same sentence. The sentence that is closest to the center functions as the representation of the whole cluster
  \item each sentence can only be in one cluster; if it is in multiple clusters it is removed from all but the largest
  \item each sentence has to be in exactly one clusters, so many clusters include only one sentence
\end{itemize}
