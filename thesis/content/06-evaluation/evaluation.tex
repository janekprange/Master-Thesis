% \section{Evaluation Metrics}
% \label{sec:evaluation:metrics}

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item SFAM
%         \begin{itemize}
%           \item accuracy and F1 with regard to labels from select examples of the attribute sentence generation (was the sentence used or not)
%         \end{itemize}
%   \item LISA
%         \begin{itemize}
%           \item MSE, MAE, avg. cosine similarity compared to SFAM prediction
%           \item accuracy and F1 compared to SFAM where both predictions are rounded
%         \end{itemize}
%   \item embedding model
%         \begin{itemize}
%           \item accuracy through triplet loss
%                 %? \item variance inside groups
%         \end{itemize}
%   \item steering methods
%         \begin{itemize}
%           \item improvement of L2 distance to group median compared to embedding of unsteered generation
%                 \begin{itemize}
%                   \item how strong is the steering?
%                 \end{itemize}
%           \item cosine similarity between the vector that is the difference between embedding of steered and unsteered generation
%                 \begin{itemize}
%                   \item is the steering in the correct direction?
%                 \end{itemize}
%                 %? \item the absolute times that the resulting group is the correct one (according to the embedding)
%         \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}


\section{\acs{sfam}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item results in Table~\ref{table:resultSFAM}
  \item not comparable to \citet{patelLearningInterpretableStyle2023} because they did not publish the performance of \ac{sfam} on their test data
        \begin{itemize}
          \item this could be because the test dataset in this thesis uses completely unseen data
          \item their test data used the same texts, only different sentences
          \item as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:approach:clustering}, many sentences are very close in meaning while being not equal
          \item this could mean that parts of the test data are very similar to the training data, which would artificially improve the results
        \end{itemize}
  \item they did compare it to human judgments, this was not possible for this thesis due to time constraints
  \item the results show that \ac{sfam} is able to predict if an attribute sentence fits a text
  \item there is room for improvement
        \begin{itemize}
          \item using a better base model that is fine-tuned
          \item improving the creation of the synthetic dataset to reduced noise
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
