\section{Future Work/Improvements} % TODO: better title
\begin{itemize}
  \item use data for the experiments that is guaranteed to be written by specific groups
  \item use more and better data (often a possible improvement in ML/NLP)
  \item probing study to find the best layer for activation steering
  \item further experiments, if a different number of important attributes has an effect on steering (prompt steering and activation steering)
  \item compare \ac{sfam} to human judgements like \citet{patelLearningInterpretableStyle2023}
  \item activation steering not based on the median attribute vector of a group but the attribute vector of a single text to replicate its style.
\end{itemize}
