# Besprechungsnotizen

- refactored database schema
- added validation sets for sfam and lisa
- removed target prompts male pronouns and female pronouns
	- cosine similarity war zu nah (z.T. > 0.9)
- added sentence filtering
	- sentences mit " not " und " avoid(s) ", aber andere wären sehr einfach hinzuzufügen
	- " mention(s) " und quotes würden nicht störende Sätze entfernen
- die ersten style attribute sind die targets prompts
	- Anzahl ist dynamisch, falls noch andere target prompts entfernt werden
	- die Reihenfolge ist die gleich wie die der prompts
- fixed bug with clustering algorithm
	- zwei Werte konnten beide fast, aber nicht ganz null Abstand zum Zentrum haben; das hat zu einer Dauerschleife geführt
- improved sfam training
	- tried balanced accuracy, but it is difficult because each row in the dataset has its own weight
- implemented idea for getting the most important style attributes per group
