# Besprechungsnotizen

- Style sentence generation ist grundsätzlich fertig
	- es werden style Vektoren berechnet die für das sfam Training verwendet werden
- ich kann jetzt parallel auf Overleaf arbeiten
- wäre es möglich einmal ein gutes experiment setup zu sehen?
- soll ich im experiment setup auch auf die Datenbank eingehen und wie ich die Daten gespeichert habe? Oder nur was ich mache und nicht wie ich das implementiert habe? (Auch Details wie die db backups)
- ich habe die target definition aus den targeted prompts entfernt, llama hat zu oft Passagen aus der Definition übernommen
	- Das auch in die Thesis schreiben?
	- Eine Möglichkeit wäre, die Definition in den System Prompt zu schreiben, aber die Antworten sind so eigentlich sehr gut
- Tipps für quantized models mit vllm?
	- download quantized model oder quantize mit vllm?
	- eventuell kann dadurch die performance noch besser werden 
- Tipps für Basismodelle für SFAM und LISA, die ich dann fine tune?
- Alternative Idee: Für die Style sentence generation das chat template benutzen, sodass auch die ursprüngliche Input im Prompt enthalten ist
	- Vielleicht als Idee im Hinterkopf behalten wenn ich mit dem Rest schnell voran komme

## Interessante Beispiele

- einige targeted prompts scheinen anfälliger für Noise zu sein

She says, Good lord I hope it is not that If she were casually sick, why would she refer the sickness as that? she should be talking about the sickness that comes with pregnancy. The discussion further about children and childbearing only confirms that. They say the bride is always so blushing and proud and happy when she finds that out, but�I'd hate it! Why would a bride blush about sickness unless it is pregnancy?

The momentum is given by: p = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt F(t) The change of momentum \dot{p}(t) is therefore related to the force F(t). If you want you can say that in some sense your statement is true. Does this answer your question or what exactly do you understand by current?
================================================================================

Words Expressing Illness
================================================================================
The author uses words expressing illness to describe the concept of momentum in physics, specifically in the context of the equation p = ∫[t0,t1] dt F(t). The word "illness" is not explicitly used in the passage, but the word "force" is used, which can be associated with physical stress or pressure, and "momentum" is related to physical movement or displacement.
================================================================================

================================================================================
Here's the rewritten list:

1. The author uses words expressing illness to describe a concept.
2. The author associates force with physical stress or pressure.
3. The author relates momentum to physical movement or displacement.

In general, proving things is a creative enterprise. As such, there is no standard template: you're free to do whatever you want, as long as it's logically valid. In particular, as long as you understand why a proof works, you shouldn't worry too much about whether it's a proof by contradiction, or a proof by counterexample, or something else. That's a bit like a poet wondering whether a particular phrasing they've used is a zeugma or a syllepsis. As long as it's effective imagery, who cares except the critics?
================================================================================

Female Pronouns
================================================================================
The author uses the female pronoun "she" in the phrase "a poet wondering whether a particular phrasing they've used is a zeugma or a syllepsis." This indicates that the author is using the pronoun "she" to refer to a poet, but the pronoun is not explicitly tied to a specific, named female individual. Instead, the author is using the pronoun to represent a general or hypothetical poet, making it an example or illustration rather than a specific reference to a female person.
