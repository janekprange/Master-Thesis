In fact, other members of the same species, because they have the same resource needs, are the most direct competitors.

[Edit for clarity: the air isn't the main reason (just wanted to illustrate how *everything* on the surface is moving together), the main thing is starting off with the same velocity as the ground. Though the air's motion would be needed to explain the lack of Coriolis deflection etc..]",
        "Same reason why if you jump straight up you land right back where you started and not a dozen or so feet to the side. When you\u2019re standing still, you\u2019re not moving relative to your surroundings, but both you and the ground beneath you are moving at the same speed relative to the center of the earth. So you jump, you move relative to the center of the earth, but the ground below you *also* moves the same amount, so you land right back where you started. Exact same principle with taking off and hovering in a helicopter",
        "Interestingly, you kinda CAN do this, but not in a helicopter. If you take off from Oslo in, say, a 767 and head due west, you\u2019ll notice that the sun stays overhead in pretty much the same location. That\u2019s because you are staying on a line between the sun and the center of the earth while the earth rotates under you. Of course, you\u2019re also going about 600 mph relative to the air, which costs fuel.",
        "How do you define \"hovering in place?\" If you mean staying stationary over a certain point on the ground, obviously that won't work, because you'll come down in the same place you went up. If you mean following the Earth's rotation, then hovering won't work, because the Earth, and the air you're flying in, are rotating at around 1,000MPH, carrying your helicopter with them, and you're going to need to counter those forces.",
        "\"Hovering in place\" is the problem in question. Hovering in place relative to what? Going \"straight up\" in a helicopter means moving straight away from a spot on the ground. Once you are hovering, you will have to adjust the controls to stay...where? In line with that spot on the ground? Well, that will require adjusting the controls a certain way. Or maybe you will draw a line to a spot on the moon and stay lined up with that, but the moon is moving, too, of course. At some point you have to consider what the difference is between \"hovering\" and \"flying.\" There is a [relevant xkcd] about what would happen if you tried to install a fire pole connecting the earth and the moon. Your problem is similar to this if you think about it.",
        "Take off in your helicopter, have it accelerate west for a while in order to cancel out the eastward velocity it had from being on the ground, and then proceed to push against the wind (that's more or less rotating in the same direction as the ground) at a sufficient rate to overcome its motion, and Voila! You're \"hovering in place\" (which is to say, traveling westward at something on the order of a thousand miles per hour or somesuch). IOW, \"in place\" is a very strange concept to keep clear in this situation. I suppose the easiest way to consider it in a frame where it's the surface of the Earth that's moving is to keep the sun in the exact same spot in your sky, and thus be motionless w/r/t the sun, while the Earth rotates beneath you. But in practice that looks like flying westward really, really, really fast",
        "1. You're in a medium that moves along with the rest of the planet (air), so \"hovering in place\" means hovering above the same spot on the ground and thus rotating along with it. 2. You already have the velocity of the Earth, similar to how 2 people can throw a ball between each other inside a moving train, without having the ball instantly fly through the back of the train",
        "Go into a car and ride as a passenger. Bring a small hand-held ball. Have the driver go a significant speed such as 40mph or more. Toss the small ball into the air and catch it. Why did you succeed in catching it? Why didn't the ball go flying into you at 40mph or more as soon as you released it? The answer is that the ball is moving relative to the car. The ball was moving 40mph with the car. When you threw the ball it went upwards while maintaining the forward motion relative to the car. Even though you released all physical contact to the ball it kept moving relative to the car because nothing had changed it's momentum relative to the car. &#x200B; A helicopter is the same thing. It might lift off the Earth physically, but there was no force applied to it which counteracted the continuous spin of the Earth. &#x200B; I didn't explain it super well and I might have gotten somethings wrong. But that's because it was midnight when I typed this and I'm about to go to sleep. But I hope my explanation helped at least a little bit intuitively.",
        "In a helicopter you move relative to the air you\u2019re hovering in. The air moves relative to the Earth (or doesn\u2019t). We\u2019d typically refer to the air as \u201cstill\u201d if there\u2019s no wind, meaning it is not moving relative to the ground. This should get you far enough to recognize that the air and ground are moving mostly together most of the time. So now we can look at what it\u2019d take for you to just hover \u201cin place\u201d (in this context, not moving with respect to the air, not with respect to the ground) to reach the other side of the world. At ~24h/day and ~40,000km circumference, at the equator, the surface is moving roughly 1670km/h. You\u2019d need to take off from the surface into wind blowing west at 1670km/h and have it continue blowing uniformly for 12 hours. Although you\u2019d be completely fine in this unrealistically uniform westward wind, I can\u2019t recommend the takeoff.",
        "All the answers about the atmosphere moving with the earth\u2019s rotation are hypothetically correct, but also, a helicopter is pretty difficult to control. Just like you are constantly adjusting the steering wheel of a car to go in a straight line, I\u2019m pretty sure a helicopter pilot has to actively and constantly adjust the controls to hover above a specific point on the ground. I do t doh t there is automation that helps \u201clock\u201d a helicopter in a specific spot relative to the ground when desired, but that still involves manipulation of the controls. The atmosphere doesn\u2019t move perfectly with the surface of the earth. There is almost always something called \u201cwind\u201d particularly further from the ground. This, among other things, works against a perfectly stable hover.",
        "You were already rotating *along with* the surface of the Earth before you left the ground. There\u2019s no reason you\u2019d suddenly lose all that angular momentum just because you went up into the air. Your suggestion that you\u2019d get \u201cleft behind\u201d as the ground rotated underneath you is analogous to the suggestion that you\u2019d get \u201cleft behind\u201d by a moving train if you jumped upward while you were standing inside one of its rail cars, and thus as soon as you jumped, the back wall of the rail car would rush up to meet you at 200 km/h. Clearly this doesn\u2019t happen (based on everyday experience). The reason is that you have inertia, or equivalently, that momentum is conserved. You were already moving forward horizontally *along with* the train before you jumped, and you continue to do so once you\u2019re in the air. The Earth picture is complicated a bit by relative motion between atmosphere and ground, and by Coriolis effects. But these are small, and the basic answer to your question being that \u201cmomentum is conserved\u201d still stands.",
        "If you think about it, you are currently moving at the same speed the earth is. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t feel any motion, nothing is causing motion we are just in motion. So, for this to work you would have to find a way to not only halt the effects of gravity but also quickly stop your speed (which will likely have enough force to kill you) then come back up to speed once you arrive at your destination.",
        "You and earth are part of the same frame of reference system. Your initial velocity is not zero if you look at it from outside the Earth being frame of reference. You will have to actively spend fuel to stay in the same place in turn go backwards if someone outside the Earth is looking at it.",
        "Momentum. And not just yours. When the helicopter stands firm on the ground, it and the earth both rotate around the center at the same speed.  When it flies up, that is still (mostly) the case. Technically the relative velocity would change slightly, since you're now further away, traveling at the same speed so you need to cover a larger distance. If my calcultations are right, the helicopter would lose about 250 meters per 1 hour per 1 kilometer in height at the equator. So If you were to fly up to 1 kilometer for 12 hours, you would have moved 3 Kilometers relative to your starting location. If you were to fly to 2 kilometers for 12 hours, it would be 6. However, the helicopter the only thing that carries the momentum from the earth. So does the air, which should follow the same pattern, however wind, which is mostly driven by temperature overwhelms this many times and would be the actual cause of any drift caused in this thought experiment.",
        "First, you'd need a helicopter with enough fuel to hover for 12 hours. The average helicopter can fly for 2.5-5 hours. But also, you have inertia. A helicopter parked on the ground at the equator is technically moving with the surface of earth and the atmosphere at something like 1700 kph. You'd have to take off and fly 1700 kph in the opposite direction (follow the sun). In order to stay in place, relative to earth's orbit. If you wanna disregard Earth's orbit, too, and wait a year for earth to come back, you'd have to go 107,000 kph, straight up, from the equator, at dawn (I think) and also somehow not get pulled into the sun's gravity, for 365 days.",
        "Well you can. But unless you\u2019re near the top or the bottom of the spin axis, you\u2019d need a supersonic helicopter to \u201cdecelerate\u201d to \u201cstationary\u201d and to maintain the \u201cstationary\u201d (angular) velocity against all that air resistance. What you describe is essentially flying in the opposite direction of the earth\u2019s spin at supersonic speeds. You can think of it as the same concept as swimming against a current in order to stay stationary relative to the solid ground. Only the fluid in this case is air and the \u201ccurrent\u201d is pushing everything around the earth as it spins, which at the equator is 1,674.4 km/h."

        "It depends on a numbef of things. Purity is a big one. Not just \"how pure is it overall\", but also \"is it free of certain specific impurities\". For instance, 90% \"reagent grade\" KOH will be much less expensive than 85% \"trace metal grade\" KOH: the latter may contain a bunch more water and some carbonates, but it is guaranteed to be free of transition metal impurities (at least down to ppb levels), which is quite important for applications like elemental analysis or sometimes catalysis. It costs a fair bit more to achieve that kind of purity. Besides this, there's also the issue of certificates. Sure, that product is touted to be 99.9% pure, but is there any certificate of analysis that guarantees this specific batch is indeed that pure, and mabe gives you more specific info as to what the impurities are? Because that also costs extra! Then, there's also vendor convenience and reputation. Large companies like Sigma Aldrich have well-stocked warehouses all over the world, that can rapidly ship chemicals to most labs, and have a reputation for being legit. Buying from a shady company in China may be cheaper, but if you're in Europe or North America, it may take months to arrive, and what you get may not be as pure as advertised, if not an outright scam (there was a major scandal recently in biology, with Chinese companies selling fake antibodies).

We still don't notice it on our scale because it's still so small relative to the Earth itself. If you look at the tides, you'll see stronger spring tides and weaker neap tides when we are at perihelion, but even then, the local weather will add a lot of interference much greater than the change our distance to the Sun brings. The difference between perihelion and aphelion of Earth is about 5 million km. The average radius of the Earth's orbit is about 150 million km. That's only about a 3% change between each extreme",

In fact it's so much, that I'm fairly confident that it would not be even close to safe for humans either in these amounts. The toxic effect most likely stems primarily from excess sodium ions and maybe an effect of the excess glutamate on receptors or ion channels - these would obviosuly affect the nervous system, thus the seizures. For the sake of simplicity, lets focus on sodium, and compare MSG to table salt (NaCl). NaCl has (very roughly) 1/3 of the molar mass of MSG, so we'll get 3x as much sodium ions per gram salt. So we could compare 10g MSG to 3.3 g NaCl as far as sodium content is concerned. NaCl is reportedly lethal to humans at doses of 0.5-1 g/kg bodyweight in humans.",

I would assume this has something to do with the difference in how humans and dogs regulate salts and balance water in the body. Two things come to mind on this sodium regulation difference: dogs have a higher creatinine range and lower levels of aldosterone. As one commenter mentioned, that level of salt is quite the heavy dose. Its an odd field of science to find lethal dose ranges, but they do play an important role in understanding health outcomes from exposure."

This is not about finding truths behind the curtain of propaganda, this is about functionality. Your beliefs and convictions influence your behaviour. Your behaviour should be so that it helps you function in society. Does North Korean propaganda help you function in a western society? Propably not. So OPs question is a valid one. I personally have no experience helping brainwashed people in any way, but I do have experience with showing people how they can view their own opinions and beliefs through the lense of functionality so they can decide on their own if something is helpful or not. There are selfreflectionmodels you can use to help someone see how a belief can result in behaviour. Believing \"A\" results in doing \"B\". Robert Dilts made such a model. I think its called the levels of conviction. Next you have to listen for values. By making clear what a person values you can then ask if \"doing B\" is in line with those values. This way you can let a person decide for themselves, you dont have to tell them anything. Hope this helps.",

      "output": [
        "NEET is an incredibly loaded term defined at the level of policy, and a lot of meta-analysis demonstrates that the way it is understood and defined in policy causes a lot more problems than laypeople think. My frame of reference is [*The Dynamics of Marginalized Youth*], but the main thing I want to stress is that this discussion has been going on for a very long time. Furthermore, while it's attractive as a social concept, NEET is heavily debated as to whether it's worthwhile as a sociological term. The reason why NEET phenomenons are seen as so high is because what defines a NEET is inconsistent. You might say, \"Well, it's just people who aren't in education, employment, or training - it's right in the title!\" But the problem, as the text notes, is that this could include groups like housewives or underemployed people. Addressing the NEET phenomenon - as it has traditionally been conceived - primarily boiled down to quantifiable metrics, which were questionable as to whether they truly reflected what discussants of the NEET phenomenon were trying actually to capture. The low educational attainment has largely been attributed to factors like truancy. Still, truancy is a somewhat fraught metric, considering that it oftentimes directs attention away from structural education issues and towards family or personal issues. Likewise, some countries don't make an exception for \"men looking for work,\" which had to be brought up in Japan's reconfiguration of the term. This tension between structural expectation and personal responsibility is at the heart of why NEET problems are unresolved. Women are in an especially difficult position because of the NEET label. In Japan, the term NEET isn't used: it's Niito (just 'Neet'), but it \"accounts\" for housewives. This leads to the second NEET problem: it leads to social expectations of work-oriented identities. In the Japanese definition, a housewife is not a NEET, but if she doesn't want to be a housewife or a NEET, she should be employed, of which the employment of women in gainful jobs in [Japan is much lower than men]. In short, the dilemma becomes \"be a housewife\" or \"be a (likely) part-time worker...and then become a housewife.\" If you're outside of that label, you're a NEET. Long story short, the term has no consistency; every country tackles it differently."

      "output": [
        "It arguably has to do with some fundamental changes in how homosexuality was perceived, and yes a sort of paradoxical effect where more visibility and to some extent acceptance of homosexuality resulted in more fear of being labeled as one. First of all, the concept of \"the homosexual\" as a kind of person and especially as a fixed orientation from early development is a relatively recent historical development. Prior to that it might be viewed as a sinful or morally questionable behavior any man might potentially indulge in (but rarely actually occurred), or something that a specific small set of men might be prone to because of one or more degenerate conditions (moral, mental, or physical). The idea that homosexuality might be tied to effeminacy was already floating around as well, linked to this idea of degeneracy, no doubt. Tied in with that at least among the more educated classes might also be some historical association with things like Greek and Roman pederastic practices specifically. So, many people would be largely unaware that homosexuality exists or at least thinking about it very much if at all - sort of like how people in the US today don't typically spend a lot of time contemplating the concept of \"temple prostitution\". In the 1913 medical report linked below the physician reports that while he had patients who were overtly homosexual, he also had diagnosed \\*several\\* men who had no self-awareness of their homosexuality as being homosexual when they came in complaining of sexual dysfunction (presumably with their wives). Details from at least one of the cases shared demonstrates just how much a social frame for interpreting experience is important to understanding it in a particular way. Among those with more awareness or concern about homosexual behavior, distancing it from yourself is much easier psychologically if you can, for example, distinguish yourself and your friend from moral and mental degenerates and pedophiles. Or, for example, if you and your friend aren't effeminate. And also you aren't going to really be worried about other people trying to label or accuse you if you clearly aren't those things. Even if affection between you and your friend crosses over into the sexual, you can view that as a one-time moral failing you should avoid in the future, rather than indicating some kind of inherent connection with being affectionate with your friend. Tied with all of that, and maybe even more importantly, is that there is no social awareness of a model of homosexual relationships (again, at least beyond historical pederasty). Men being affectionate with one another can't easily connotate that they are a couple if there are no visible same-sex couples or even the idea of same-sex couples in the culture. All of this starts to crumble as public information about sexuality spreads and as gay subcultures start to coalesce. Kinsey's report got a lot of cultural attention in part because he reported homosexual behavior among men was much more widespread than was believed. \"The homosexual\" becomes a culturally known figure, with all that implies. You also have more general cultural awareness and visibility of gay culture, especially in large cities, eventually extending to visible same-sex couples. Early medical article on homosexuality & Kinsey writings on homosexuality that reflect some of these issues: &#x200B;",
        "Because they weren't worried about being called gay. Homosexuality was considered so taboo that that it wouldn't have even crossed their minds that writing flowery letters or holding hands or kissing the cheek would signal anything other than close friendship. As visibility and awareness of gay people increased, it became necessary for men to go out of their way to signal \"I AM NOT GAY\" to avoid accusations and rumors (which could seriously harm both their ego and reputation due to the widespread homophobia of the societies in which they lived). That lack of being worried about being called gay was the status quo for much of history. Consider the tenderness between Achilles and Patroclus in the Iliad, or the more recent doting friendship between Alexander Hamilton and John Laurens. These relationships demonstrate an immense amount of intimacy, loyalty, and devotion. If you ask today's \"macho men\" why they avoid such displays of intimacy, they will almost always say that it's because it's \"gay\", and when one is raised in a homophobic society and takes the homophobic worldview to heart, being gay or even being suspected of being gay is one of the worst things imaginable, so they are willing to forgo friendships and intimacy to avoid it. In \"Self-Made Man\", butch lesbian Norah Vincent goes undercover as a man named Ned to get a close-up look at male spaces, and is consistently shocked and worn down by the lack of intimacy in the lives of American men, to the point it impacting her own mental health. Every single man she talked to expressed that that main reason they avoided such intimacy with other men was from a fear of being thought gay. This avoidance of male intimacy is not the historical norm, and arose only quite recently (within the last 200 years or so) as a homophobic response to the increasing visibility and awareness of homosexuality in the public imagination.  *Self-Made Man*, Norah Vincent, 2008."

From a materials stand point it's often much easier to detect existence or absence rather than any other range of values. It's noteworthy that Morse code and Braille build off of the binary concept but are more than just \"more binary\". Morse can be considered a full fledged protocol - you have encoding using dots or dashes, transmission rules and timing (length of time between dots/dashes, characters, words), and some error handling if you want to get into Q codes. Braille is more of an encoding scheme than protocol, but each character consists of multiple binary bits. If you'd like a simple introduction to the ideas please check out Charles Petzold's CODE. The first two chapters talk about this concept with these examples; it's also represented on the cover of the book.",
        "In terms of implementation, it's generally much simpler to *distinguish* between two possibilities, rather than three or more. For instance, in a digital logic circuit, there are two signal levels: \"low\" meaning 0, and \"high\" meaning 1. We can use these to control a circuit that has two different behaviors, one when turned off and one when turned on. If we went to 3 voltage levels, then there would be an \"intermediate\" level, and it's much harder to design a circuit such that the in-between point *also* reliably behaves in a useful way. Note that we *do* use more than 2 voltage levels, in situations when there are advantages to doing so. For example, Gigabit Ethernet uses 5 levels (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2). This requires extra analog circuitry to convert to and from the normal binary representation on either end of the connection. It's worth doing this for Ethernet, because it allows us to encode more data over the same cheap physical cable. It wouldn't be worth doing the same thing for every single logic gate in a CPU, because it would add a huge amount of physical size and inefficiency. Similarly, the most basic flash memory designs store 1 bit in each memory cell, but you can also use \"multi-level cells\" which store one of 4 possible analog values per cell, which is 2 bits' worth of storage. Likewise for TLC (8 levels = 3 bits) and QLC (16 levels = 4 bits).",
        "The history of the [Telegraph] is telling here: original designs had multiple arms that could be \"up\" or \"down\". With operation, individual arms would fail, but operators would find workarounds how to get by with less arms. That's happened *on the fly*, like a new language evolving. Generally, more states per item transferred are a burden on the hardware transport layer. Many protocols have moved to fewer states transmitted much faster, increasing throughput.",
        "I shudder to think about a version of Braille that used, say, *semi*-raised dots in addition to flat and raised. It's hard enough to get businesses and government organizations to provide Braille as it is, let alone a trinary version that would be harder to get right and more easy for readers to confuse.",
        "Most codes don't have two characters. Arabic numbers have 10. The English alphabet has 26. Roman numerals have seven. In general, there's nothing magical about any of those choices, and we tend to decide each case individually through some combination of practical considerations or just accidents of history. For computers, we use binary because there are very practical benefits to building electronic devices based on two-state logic. A voltage on a wire is either high or low. We could build (and at times in history, we have built) computers that had three states, and then you need 0, 1, and 2, or high, medium, and low voltages. But it turns out that it's easier to make transistors that only care about high and low, and there's no real advantage to ternary vs binary logic, so why not do the thing that's easy."

GPUs have dedicated hardware designed to do exactly this operation, and as you can imagine, a lot of work has been put into optimizing and parallelizing it.

Anything beyond that isn't something you need at the moment. If you're a beginner, create a free wix account and have a look around. Get a feel for creating your website and playing with plugins and things. If you don't want to code then that's one of your best starting points. Good luck",
        "How websites work: 1. User types an address in their browser (like www.reddit.com). 2. The browser looks up that address in a global system called DNS to find out how to talk to the server (its IP address) that hosts that web site. 3. The browser opens up a connection to that IP address and sends a message in a special little language called HTTP saying \"please send me this web page\". 4. The server accepts that message and sends the web page back, again using the HTTP \"language\". So to run a web site, you need 1. A name that you control that users can use to find you (like reddit.com). 2. A way to tell the global DNS system \"when someone asks for my name\", send them to this address. 3. A computer running with that address that can listen for those incoming messages 4. Software running on that computer that knows how to interpret and respond to those messages There are lots of companies that will set all this stuff up for you and give you basically a little application where you can just design what you want the page to look like, and they'll take care of everything for you. Squarespace.com is a popular one that you'll hear advertised a lot, just to take one example. If you want to learn how to do it yourself, you can solve each of these steps independently on your own. You buy a domain name from a registrar. Again, there are hundreds of choices here. I like hover.com. I hear a lot of people talk about namecheap.com. They all provide the same service, but maybe with different levels of friendly interfaces, etc. it costs about $15-20 a year to buy a domain. You can run the server out of your house on your own PC if you want, but it's not a good idea. For one thing, opening up your home computer and network to the whole internet is a bad idea security wise. And most ISPs don't like allowing incoming traffic -- they don't really want you running web sites off your residential connection. So instead you can either find a dedicated hosting company that will bundle up #3 and #4 in the list above and do it all for you. There are a fair number that will do it for free if you don't have much traffic. I use cloudflare.com for example, though it's probably not the easiest to use if you don't know what you're doing. Or you can separate out #3 and #4 and find a hosting company that will just rent you a server to do with whatever you want. Linode.com is an example of this. They'll rent you the server, and then you are responsible for installing and configuring the HTTP server software and configuring it to serve out your web site. Popular choices for this include nginx or Apache. You could also then run a database on that server (or a different one) and have your web site do things like serve out dynamic content instead of just static web pages. Whichever option you choose for hosting, you'll have to go back to your registrar where you bought the domain and configure your DNS settings. So if you get a server through Linode, Linode will tell you what your IP address is. You then go back to your registrar (e.g. Hover) and tell them that when someone requests your \"www.my-awesome-web-site.gg\", to send them to the address you got from Linode. There are a few more complexities. These days, everything expects HTTPS, which requires getting certificates and configuring them. But in terms of minimal ways to get a working web site from scratch, this is pretty much it.",
        "If you have your own computer that is always on you can self host. You would need a domain name so people could find it. You would usually need software which updates your registration record with your IP address which changes over time. Your internet company doesn\u2019t like this, but won\u2019t notice as you get very little traffic. Better to go with a hosting service. Some cost money. Some are free, but show ads (for which you get no revenue). I consider ads an eyesore, but other people tolerate them. The hosting service will provide more features for higher prices. At its most basic they will give you a static site. If you simply want to get content out there, that is sufficient. All the big cloud providers will host a website. Azure will give you a static site for the cost of blob storage (pennies per GB per month).",
        "There are several types of website hosting. The simplest and cheapest is static web hosting. This means users can't persist any changes (e.g. creating a forum post). One popular way to host these is using github pages, which I use for my personal website. It is free. Next up you have shared web hosting. This type of hosting usually comes with a control panel for making your changes, but the actual host is serving multiple websites, not just yours. The advantage is lower cost, but you can't directly manage the server (e.g. installing software) because that would affect other sites. Then there's various types of hosting that boil down to \"renting a server\", which you can install whatever software you want. You can also buy and operate the entire stack, including the hardware. I wouldn't recommend this in general, because it has a steep learning curve in comparison. However, it can be a fun hobby if you're interested in how everything works behind the scenes. \"The cloud\" offers all of these types of hosting, but you can also get it elsewhere (e.g. digital ocean)."

If you get rejected, it doesn't hurt to ask the recruiter why and to explain you are looking to improve yourself and your skills for future opportunities with them. This actually landed me an interview for a position when i had no experience. Now if you are failing before you get the interview, that means your CV might not fit. Also it might mean you are applying for positions which are not looking for your skillset. C++ is a bit tacky when it comes to finding a job. I love the language, but i know from people in the field it is extremely hard to get a job with C++ because they are looking for people with a lot of experience in other languages and deeper understanding of the processes behind C++. Finally, about your question if you know a lot as a junior or not - yeah-maybe-no-ish, it's more complex than that. When i had your skillset i got rejected also. I had to learn docker, NoSQL Databases, Java, REST, SOAP and some more things to probably get the attention of the recruiters. Quite honestly, What you are describing is useful in a very narrow window of junior job opportunities. Also i don't know what the projects you've done are, but it helps to diversify, it shows you are not afraid of trying new things or new approaches. My projects that got me hired when i applied to get my first job were a Web-Scrapper which took some information from some website and put it in my Google Calendar, a simple Frontend-backend website with a database, a tic-tac-toe bot and a mobile app which helps you plan a vacation. I didn't include all of my projects, because i wanted to show my diversity of skills. Other things i have done are hangman, labyrinth game with multiple levels, different storage structures, calculator which works with numbers larger than long long (string-based input, similar to BigCalc in Java)."

In actual, they are always connected to complete the loop/circuit. 2. To power the house, only Live & Neutral are needed. Both of this wire are the wire which completes the circuit. The earth are there just for protections and does not carry any current except during fault.",
        "For 3 phase: The three phase (conductors and load) ARE circuit loops. Originating and returning to the transformer they are derived from. On them are 60 hertz sine waves, constantly alternating between a positive and negative peak, each conductor 120\u00b0 out of phase with the other.  You can think all three phase currents combining at the load and adding up to zero and not having to return. \u2026or think of 1 phase\u2019s current returning on the other two phase conductors. Example: When the instantaneous phase current in one conductor (wave) is zero, the current (wave) in the other two conductors might be +10 amps, and -10amps. Or if one conductor (wave) is at (say) 5 amps, the other two waves are at -2.5 and -2.5 amps. This is more easily seen graphically when plotting 3 sine waves that are 120\u00b0 apart. The plot will show that when: \u201cA\u201d phase is at 0\u00b0(the zero crossing)=0, B phase is at Sine(120\u00b0)= .866 of peak; C phase is at sine (-120\u00b0) = -.866 of peak. Thus A+B+C = 0 + .866 -.866 = 0 total current. Another example: Let\u2019s take a snapshot when \u201cA\u201d phase\u2019s magnitude is at 90\u00b0 (peak of wave) = sine (90) = 1. B phase is at sine(90\u00b0+120\u00b0)= -.5; C phrase is at sine (90\u00b0+120\u00b0+120\u00b0) = -.5. Thus, A+B +C = 1 -.5 -.5 = 0 total current, as always.",
        "That live and neutral completes the loop providing the source and return path to the current. That Earth connection is for safety in layman's terms. In the diagram representing the electrical grid, the interconnection is represented by a single line for each cable to reduce the complexity and as overall that diagram as Single line diagram",
        "It depends on where you are. Apparently, in some places in Europe, residences get three phases. In the USA, typically only commercial and industrial sites get three phases. For residences, a transformer nearby will reduce the voltage and distribute a single phase with a center tap to each residence. This gives each resident the choice of 120 VAC line-to-neutral or 240 VAC line-to-line. The circuit is completed by the path between line and neutral.",
        "Direct current has a positive wire and a negative wire. The electricity flows in one and out the other forming a loop. The electricity in power lines is alternating current. Alternating current is similar to direct current with one positive and one negative, but the two wires switch which one is positive and which one is negative 60 times each second. This is beneficial because it lets us use transformers. The alternating current on the source side of the transformer creates a magnetic field that reverses each time the current reverses. That magnetic field generates current in the load side of the transformer each time it reverses. By varying the number of loops in each magnetic coil, we can control the voltage at the transformer. So to answer your first question, there are multiple circuits being completed. The first one runs from the power plant through the first transformer and back to the power plant. The next runs from the first transformer to the second transformer and back to the first transformer. This continues until the power from the last transformer connects to your house. It's common to run single phase 240v to a house. There are three wires running to the house. two of them are are connected to the transformer so that they receive alternating current with a voltage difference of 240v between them. The third wire is a neutral. The neutral is connected to the center of the transformer coil, so that it will stay half way between the voltages of the other two. The neutral is also connected to ground (earth), which brings it down to zero. Now we have three wires, +120v, 0v, -120v, with the + and - alternating. There are multiple ways to use this electricity in your home. Big things like an electric oven, electric clothes dryer or electric car charger will connect to the +120v and the -120v allowing them to use the full 240v. This completes the circuit from that last transformer. Most of the outlets in your house connect one of the 120v wires to the 0v wire. These are set up so that about half of your house is on one 120v line and the other half is on the other 120v line. If both halves used the exact same amount of power, then the circuit would be from the transformer to the first 120v half of your house to the second 120v half of your house and back to the transformer. The two halves won't be exactly equal, so the 0v neutral line carries the difference back to the transformer. This is all based on the USA. Other countries often run 50Hz instead of 60Hz and don't always split the 240v down to 120v for household outlets.",
        "Each transformer serves a handful of houses. The \"low side\" of that transformer is the completion of the house circuit(s). The house voltage wires in the transformer are insulated and wound around metal cores. The transformer works by creating magnetism from the input a/c and using that magnetism to induce output a/c. With equal number of windings on each side the voltage stays the same - an \"isolating\" transformer. Changing the winding count relative to each side allows a/c voltage to be changed. If the network was dead and you connected DC to the house wiring, an electron in the house wiring could never get further \"upstream\" than the low side windings on the transformer. Instead of one loop, think of it as multiple loops, each at a different voltage. They are energizing each other but they don't actually share electrons in the \"complete a circuit\" sense. Here is a diagram for a neighborhood: 50A black triangle is a transformer connected to the black 12kv line. The blue line is the electricity serving just the houses. Here is a blue section serving 9 houses, 5 to the south, 4 to the north: As bigger houses and EV hookups and solar (\"DG\" in a circle is \"distributed generation\") get added, additional transformers are needed and these blue sections get divided up into smaller segments.",
        "The power grid is AC. Only DC circuits have a positive and negative. The grid (simplifying it as single phase instead of 3 phase) completes the circuit using two legs with a third neutral leg - the electrical power is transferred by the rapid back and forth of the AC. There are 3 wires because the grid, at the residential level, is 240 volt, with each hot leg plus or minus 120 volts in reference to the neutral leg. This allows balancing of the amount of power being taken off each leg (each side of the panel is one of these legs) wit the grounded neutral leg offering protection against capacitive effects from plant to pole to home.",
        "Grid works in alternative current so can't be directly compared to DC circuits you see in diagrams, but it doesn't change the global idea of a closed circuit. 1 - The whole electrical grid is the live, It can be seen as a huge positive terminal, while the neutral can be seen as the negative terminal. The interesting thing is that the neutral is not carried through power lines, it is \"created\" locally, but it's not very important at this point. When you plug a device, you basically plug it between the live and the neutral, just like you would put a device between the + and - in a DC circuit. 2 - the earth wire is a safety wire only. It is physically connected to the real Earth. Devices with earth wire are usually devices with metallic parts that could be in contact with humans, like washing machine, oven, ... Earth acts like a giant neutral wire. Imagine that your device has a problem and the metallic external parts of the device are accidentaly connected to the live wire. Even if the device is off, if you touch the metallic parts you create a link between the live and the Earth through your body (from your hand to your feet), which is extremely dangerous. The earth wire is here to connect the metallic parts directly to the Earth. If there is this accidental connection between the metallic parts of the device and the live, electricity will flow to Earth through the earth wire instead of flowing through your body, even if you touch the metallic parts of the device."

If you want ultimate accuracy, servos can provide it. They are better for stand-alone applications, in fact even battery powered is possible. As far as reliability, pneumatic is really good IF you have clean dry air. Electric is really good IF you have a dry and fairly clean environment. And then there's hydraulics...",

Pneumatics have advantages that you may not require licensed electricians to maintain equipment.

And on top of that, you'll still want to run electrical cable to the pneumatic valves to obtain feedback control if it's process critical\u00a0(to confirm the valve opens and closes - valves get jammed). Electrics simplify a lot of this.",
        "It depends on the how and what's, and of course you have servo hydraulics for big stuff that use both. As a rule though, if you are not going to do much to check and maintain a system, simpler is better, and simpler usually does not involve electronics. It is funny, I have an old cleat track dozer and the governor is not working in it. Actually it is somewhat MIA, I took it off to clean up and take apart on a clean desk in a room with non carpeted floors, and it sank to the bottom of the pile. Anyway, I was pondering using it for something the other day and the idea of using a micro controller and a hobby servo came into my mind. The old governor had an elaborate linkage to the carb that I would be happy to eliminate. I may still do this, but it starts to become more and more of a PITA. Nothing on the dozer is closed from the elements well. I need a place that will be dry for the electronics. I need clean power, not too hard to get there, I need a tach signal, probably an optp coupler off the coil, it is a point and coil engine.. It sounded so simple in theory, but really the way they did it was quite amazing. fast responding, needed no power, needed no signals, was OK with getting rain/snow/ice/dirt etc, and this one was built in the 30's so lets say it broke in 2000, that is still a 60 to 70 year run on that system.

I think that MIGHT work, but I wonder if gravity is always acting on the weight, and the momentum from the stop is only temporary, would you get enough moo from a acceleration (or de acceleration). Maybe put the can on a pivot so that when you accelerate / de-accelerate it tips over? Maybe take one apart, and figure out a way to move the unit with a cable, and have a more substantial weight pulling a cable that pulls the unit?

The maximum pressure that can be recovered as the pipe goes down depends on the pressure in the tank, the density of the fluid, and the vapor pressure of the fluid. That is, if the height (y - x) is too large then the pressure at height y will fall below the vapor pressure of the fluid. This limits the maximum pressure recovery. And vapor in the pipe is likely to cause other problems. For example, if the tank were at sea-level atmospheric pressure, and the pipe was moving water at around room temperature, then 30 feet (9 m) is about the maximum height difference between y and x before you run the risk of the water vaporizing (boiling) at y.",
