        "I'll answer briefly from a classical perspective. Start with a stationary electric charge, which will have an electric field around it, which you can draw with field lines. Now a short time later, the charge has displaced as a result of the acceleration, and -- at least close to the electric charge -- the electric field lines look different. There has to be continuity in those field lines, which now have to have a bend or kink in them. Finally, keep in mind that Maxwell's equations give you a relationship between spatial derivatives of an electric field and a time derivative of a magnetic field, and vice versa. This means that a kink in an electric field line will initiate a new magnetic field, and likewise a kink in the new magnetic field will initiate a further change in the electric field -- and now you've got precisely the situation where you have an electromagnetic wave and it's headed out."

Timelines are in the order of decades and total budgets for a single drug to be developed is in the 100s of millions. Companies that are successful make a lot of drugs and that is due to having some of the best scientists. They get the best scientists because they pay the most and give competitive benefits. It all adds up and in the end you have to sell x amount of a certain drug to even make your money back. And companies do make their money back. But then is it fair to just give their product away for free after they make their money back? No, they need the extra money to increase business operations and invest in new avenues of discovery. Could they at least drop the price? Optimally yes, but does any company do this with products after they start making profit, no. It's really frustrating that the products that pharmaceutical companies make can save lives but access to these products depends on your socioeconomic background.

      "output": [
        "The process of egg donation typically involves a series of steps to maximize the number of eggs retrieved and their quality. While it might seem intuitive to just retrieve eggs directly from the ovaries without hormonal stimulation, there are several reasons why hormone administration is typically utilized: **Maximizing Egg Production:** Hormonal stimulation with medications like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) allows the ovaries to produce multiple eggs in a single cycle. Without this stimulation, only one egg is typically produced per menstrual cycle. By administering hormones, fertility specialists can increase the number of eggs available for retrieval, thus increasing the chances of success for the recipient of the donated eggs. **Timing and Synchronization:** Hormonal stimulation allows fertility clinics to synchronize the menstrual cycles of the egg donor and the recipient. This synchronization is crucial for successful implantation of the embryo in the recipient's uterus. It also allows clinics to schedule the egg retrieval procedure at a specific time, optimizing the chances of success. **Control and Monitoring:** Hormonal stimulation provides fertility specialists with greater control over the egg donation process. They can monitor the development of follicles (fluid-filled sacs in the ovaries that contain the eggs) through ultrasound and blood tests to ensure that the eggs are maturing properly. This monitoring helps prevent complications and maximizes the chances of a successful egg retrieval. **Quality Control:** By administering hormones, fertility specialists can optimize the quality of the eggs retrieved. The hormonal stimulation helps to ensure that the eggs are at the appropriate stage of development and have the best chance of resulting in a viable pregnancy.While it's theoretically possible to retrieve eggs without hormonal stimulation and then mature them *in-vitro*, this approach presents several challenges. Firstly, it's uncertain whether eggs retrieved without hormonal stimulation would be as mature or viable as those retrieved following stimulation. Additionally, *in-vitro* maturation techniques are still under development and may not be as reliable or successful as natural maturation within the body. Overall, hormonal stimulation is a well-established and effective method for maximizing the number and quality of eggs retrieved during the egg donation process, thereby increasing the chances of success for both the donor and the recipient."

They can be entangled in one of two ways, either they have the same state, or different states. They are in a superposition of whatever possible states they could be in, but we know that how that superposition will be resolved tells us how the other one would be resolved. Let's assume they're entangled to be in the same state. We entangle the particles, and move one far away at less than the speed of light, as is dictated by physics. We then measure the state of one of the particles, and then we instantly know the state of the other particle. The person at the other end can learn that same information about theirs and our particle, but that's it. If they change the state of their particle, whether or not they looked at it first, our particles are no longer entangled, so they can't change the state of our particle using theirs to transmit information.",
        "To give you a really simple answer: it really revolves around conservation laws and quantum randomness. Entanglement conserves the entangled quantities of the particles. So if you entangle electron spins, separate them by 10 ly, then measure one of them and one second later (at a pre-agreed time) measure the other, you will see spin-up and spin-down (assuming the entangled particles were perfectly entangled and not otherwise disturbed as you transported them). What you won\u2019t be able to do is force one of the two to collapse into a spin-up state, thereby forcing the other into a spin-down state. By forcing a particular measurement, you \u201cbreak\u201d the entanglement and therefore cannot communicate anything. The randomness is still there, but the quantities will still be conserved as long as the entanglement isn\u2019t broken. Tangentially: for quantum computers using entangled bits (ie qubits), the logic gates used do modify the possible states of the qubits, but in doing so you cannot make any observable difference on the outcome until you collapse the states at the very end of the computation. So in short, there are still things you can do to entangled particles that don\u2019t break the entanglement, but you just can\u2019t force an outcome to help you communicate without also breaking the entanglement.",

        "You can't really learn any physics beyond a superficial level without math. Physics *is* math, and when you take the math out you're left with imperfect analogies and only a general sense of what's going on. For simple things like basic classical mechanics, a math-light description can still be useful since we already have an intuition for the type of physics we experience every day. But for more abstract things like quantum mechanics, it becomes very difficult to really understand anything without delving into the full mathematical description. That said, I don't believe that anyone is inherently bad at math. People tend to treat math as this skill that you either innately have or you don't, when really that's not the case at all. Math, as with anything, takes time and patience to learn. You wouldn't say \"I'm so bad at French\" because you can't read a book in French when you've never actually studied it, that would be silly. How could you possibly expect to just know French if you've never studied it? But if you take the time to learn French, starting from basic words and phrases and working your way up to more complex grammar and vocabulary, you will eventually be speak and understand it. It's the same idea with math and physics.",

While I've taken most all of the undergrad math you'd need to get started, that was years ago and I couldn't do any calculus or linear algebra today. But physics is really interesting, even if my superficial understanding won't ever near a physicist's. I find a lot of content (like made for television or popular youtube content) to be a little too simplified and redundant. At the same time, plenty of higher level books, papers, and articles often go over my head, especially with the emphasis on math. One of the coolest resources I've stumbled upon for someone like you or me is \"The Great Courses\", which I think had a free month trial on Roku to a subset of their courses. It's basically intro level undergrad lectures by college professors, but geared much more towards laypeople. \"Nuclear Physics Explained\" with Dr. Lawrence Weinstein is one that is certainly worth the 12 hour watch, in that it is incredibly dense without ever getting so technical that you'd need much of a math background to follow along.",

Eating too much kelp can adversely affect your thyroid (, and several species of seaweed can accumulate arsenic in their tissues. That said, there is a difference between the predators--herbivores--in the ocean vs. on land. On land the predators with the largest impact on plants and fungi are mammals and insects. We're mammals, so any plant that has evolved secondary metabolites to ward off mammals is likely to affect us as well. Mammalian herbivores are very rare in the ocean: there are manatees and dugongs, and sometimes coastal ungulates will snack on algae. But the main predators of seaweed are things like snails, sea urchins, and chitons. Their physiology is different enough from ours--and so is their body size--that chemical defenses manufactured by the algae are unlikely to be effective against both us and, say, snails. \\[edit: misspelled 'chiton' as 'chitin'--wrong biology topic!\\]"

It is inefficient to have eyes on one part and the neural processing of visual stimulus in the other. But why on the frontal part of the body, and not on the middle? First, you want your sensory organs and your ingestive structures (jaws or whatever) closely together, so you can know what are you eating. Second, you want them roughly on the part of your body that moves \"ahead of the rest\", so you can sense where you are going and what lies in front of you. This is doubly so for predators, who have to catch their food. Third, you want your neural structures that analyze sensory information and give motor commands to coordinate movements, as closely as posible to those sensory organs, so you can react as quick as possible to the information. The fragments of seconds that takes for an action potential to travel across your body may seem a rounding error, but they are measurable and can be the difference between catching your prey or let it escape. This is the short, simple version. Not all animals follow this principle (nature loves her exceptions), and there are other selective pressures that favours cephalization. But is a process that started quite early in our evolutionary history, almost at the same time than symmetry and tissue diferentiation, so it's clearly a big step.

Secondly we need to be able to safely get rid of/and or store the excess. In case of fat for example, we have specific spaces to store it in. Excess vitamin C is simply flushed out. But if you ingest a large chunk of phosphorus, you encounter 2 problems. 1: we lack the tool to recognize and break down this chunk, and 2: we don't have a space to store this large amount and it will interfere and/or react with other compounds and processes in the body. Getting rid of the toxin is also hard of you can't recognize the stuff properly, and usually doesn't go without damage either (think of alcohol for example, which is toxic even though our liver can remove quite well). To add to this, quite some elements are very eager to initiate reactions with other elements, proteins, or even DNA, and are handled with care. You can imagine a system being built on handling trace amounts of an element getting overloaded by an immense amount of it at once. Other processes that you can think of following these two \"rules\" : - Vit A absorption is dependent on its association with fats. This makes it recognizeable by the enzyme responsible for taking it in. - Excess vitamin B is also toxic: we can not safely store a large amount of it. - Even excess water is toxic: you can only get rid of a certain amount in a certain timeframe, and safe storage of water is limited to a certain amount as well."

Nothing else can do carbon's job nearly as well as carbon can. The runner up is silicon, and it fails at a lot of things.",
        "This is a question in the field of astrobiology, not physics, but it's something I know about so here you go. Astrobiologists [have considered other elements] as possible building blocks for life, but they all have some serious shortcomings. A backbone for life must have two important properties: **Stability**: If the binding energy of bonds in a molecule is too low, random thermal collisions with other molecules or the energy of sunlight will break them. On the other hand, if the bond energies are too high, biochemistry will be unable to break them apart to make new molecules. **Valence**: A backbone of life must be able to bind to at least three other atoms to create complex networks rather than just simple chains. Carbon is tetravalent, meaning it can bind to up to four other atoms. Its compounds are quite stable at room temperature, but the [binding energies] are only a little less than the energy per photon of sunlight, so photosynthesis is possible but photodissociation is rare. Its binding energy with hydrogen, oxygen, or other carbons are all similar, so it's happy to form bonds with all of them at once. Now let's compare some of carbon's neighbors on the periodic table. Nitrogen is trivalent, So it can form molecular networks but simpler ones. However, the N-N triple bond is incredibly stable, and almost impossible to break. Large amounts of nitrogen form nitrogen gas (N2) and little else. Boron is pentavalent, so it could form very complex networks, except that boron-oxygen double bonds are incredibly stable and impossible to break. Boron forms oxides and that's about it. Silicon is the most interesting. Like carbon, it is tetravalent, so it forms bonds with four other things. Its bond energies are similar to carbon's: less than sunlight, but not a lot less. It \"likes\" oxygen a bit more than carbon does, but it *does* still [form complex molecules] with hydrogen and oxygen. However, while carbon dioxide is a gas, silicon dioxide(quartz) is a solid at Earth surface temperatures, which is inconvenient for chemistry to say the least. And at temperatures where quartz is a liquid, complex silicon compounds are no longer stable. But an even bigger problem is that silicon does not form double or triple bonds With itself like carbon does. This drastically reduces the possible complexity of molecules and prevents the formation of [aromatic compounds], which are vital to the biochemistry of life as we know it. Which isn't to say that life based on silicon or another element I haven't mentioned here is impossible but astrobiologists haven't figured out how to make it work.",
        "I've been looking into this just a bit. For instance looking for carbon-based compounds other than nucleic acids that could support life. First of all. Carbon is extremely common in the universe, has four bonds to make a plethora of different molecules, forms stable aromatic rings with ease. Carbohydrates are an almost perfect way to combine carbon and water to store energy, but phosphates are even better, which helps explain why RNA is made from a string of carbohydrates and phosphates. Anyway, back to alternatives to carbon. Nitrogen has only 3 bonds and has to be kept away from itself to avoid it collapsing into N2. Boron tends to form minerals, borates rather than polymers. Aluminium ditto. Silicon has bonds at the wrong angles, and such an affinity to oxygen and nitrogen that ... Phosphorus based life is probably a bit easier than nitrogen based life, and phosphorus exists commonly in multiple forms unlike N2. Sulfur exists in multiple forms as well, but is severely hampered by having only two bonds. Which brings us to arsenic. I don't know enough to rule out arsenic-based life completely but it would have to be rarer than carbon-based because it's a rarer element, and only has 3 bonds. This is not a good answer, sorry, I'll give it some more thought.",
        "Well, just look at the number of organic molecules compared to non-organic substances. The variety of possible substances without carbon is very very limited. Silicon, with a similar electron structure than carbon, is not water soluble, can't form double bonds; it can't form any small rings, no aromatic compounds, and SiO2 is a solid. Good luck forming any sort of life with that, and with other elements it's even worse.",
        "We only have one example of how life can work. So we know it\u2019s possible in a \u201chabitable zone\u201d in an environment with carbon (which can create stable and triple bonds), oxygen and hydrogen. Life could be made out of pure energy and exist on a scale or timeframe beyond our ability to observe\u2026 Since the possibilities are endless we\u2019re starting with the low hanging fruit.",
        "It's not. But we suspect MOST life is probably carbon based for a few reasons: **Structural nanotechnology** To do anything interesting (and life-like), life requires complicated branching molecules like proteins - which are basically nano-robots that do all the molecular-scale work that makes life possible. Branching molecules form most easily around atoms that make a full four chemical bonds per atom, and readily form long chains. Basically carbon or silicon, and silicon doesn't readily make long chains on its own, instead alternating with oxygen, which doesn't branch, and only makes the \"spine\" longer and more unwieldy. Other atoms can also make branching chains, but to get a similar versatility you need more of them in more complicated arrangements just to make the repeating \"spine\" - and the more complicated you make the foundation, the less frequently it will \"just happen\". And, probably, the, more ways there are to randomly assemble it into something useless instead of useful - which makes random mutations more likely to cause problems than improvements, making evolution more difficult. **Metabolic pathways** Silicon based life also has the problem that, just like the metabolic endpoint (no more energy can be extracted) for carbon is CO2, the endpoint for silicon is SiO2. But while CO2 is a moderately reactive gas that readily dissolves in water, and can be broken down into its constituent elements and \"recycled\" into fresh biomass via a wide number of different chemical reactions, SiO2 is stable, inert quartz sand that can't be readily converted to anything else via known low-energy reactions. Makes evolving a sustainable biosphere a little tricky if your biomass all slowly turns to sand, that you can't turn back into biomass. Though maybe we just haven't stumble on the right catalyst yet, or silicon works better at much higher temperatures, etc. It's not ruled out, it's just... probably more complicated, which probably means it happens more rarely. **Available resources** Being part of the C-N-O fusion cycle that powers most(?) stars, Carbon is the 4th-most abundant element in the universe, about 10x more abundant than silicon (which is the 8th). Meaning that even if silicon were every bit as suitable a foundation for life, we'd still expect to find carbon-based life 10x more frequently, just based on elemental abundance. In addition, carbon-based amino acids, the modestly complicated (\\~20 atoms on average) \"lego block\" molecules from which both our genetic material and our nano-robot proteins are made, appear to form spontaneously under a wide range of conditions, from volcanic vents, to lightning strikes in oxygen poor CO2 atmospheres, to the gas clouds left behind after a supernova. We see them everywhere we look throughout the universe. No other element even begins to compete in the observed abundance of modestly complicated \"precursor to life\" molecules. Which makes it likely that most life in the universe will be based on amino acids, and thus carbon. Just because it's a lot easier to accidentally build something interesting out of lego blocks (amino acids) than marbles (the comparatively simple molecules most other elements tend to spontaneously form)",
        "It isn't. All life that we know of is carbon based. Therefore if you want to search for life, you should start by looking for the signs of carbon based life, because that is the only type of life we know could definitely exist. Maybe life based around other elements could exist. We don't know. So why would we look for that? We've still got plenty of searching to do, why would you start by looking for lifeforms that hypothetically could exist instead of lifeforms that definitely can exist? But the answer is \"it is not widely accepted that life could not exist without carbon\". It's still debated. We still don't know a whole lot about how life began, so it's hard to speculate. I'm no chemist, and no biologist, but from what I've read the most sensible conclusion is that it is possible life could exist based on other elements, but it'd likely be more simple than the carbon based life that we know.",
        "But life does not need to be based on carbon. The only thing we know is that all life on earth is based on carbon. There are genres in science where potential other chemistry is discussed but we have no way of confirming any of it today, so we concentrate our efforts in what we know is possible, hence we look for liquid water and carbon chemistry in exo-planets."

When viruses pack their genetic information it is either in the naked/non-enveloped format where there is just a protein capsid (shell) surrounding the DNA/RNA or there are additional layers like a host-cell derived membrane (enveloped). These structures serve to protect the DNA/RNA from degradation when viruses are floating between cells or are on inanimate surfaces. With the proper protection, their RNA is not easily degraded, so they can circumvent that issue. And as mentioned, their simplicity allows for this lifestyle because something more complex like a nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) needs to do a lot more itself to get the same job done. Some of these NCLDVs are even bigger than the smallest bacteria. I think the largest RNA viruses cap out at about 30 kb in size which are the coronaviruses.

This means the plane is experiencing a constant 1g force on a reference point, usually the floor. This is a misnomer as 1g is exactly the acceleration due to gravity. Unaccelerated really means not 1g. Here is a video of Bob Hoover demonstrating this concept. He flies a barrel roll, which is an unaccelerated corkscrew path though space. The maneuver starts by pitching up and doing a bank at the same instant, the amount of stick applied just exactly right to maintain a 1g force.",

If the plane just all of a sudden pivoted to move the nose to the right you would go flying toward the left side of the plane. By banking, the inertia of your body going forward is directed towards the floor of the plane. Do this well enough and you don't feel a change in direction of pull at all.",

I've had crystals dislodged in my inner ear before, and when they shift, it feels like you're falling over. The CEM can be really horrible, it feels like the whole room is shaking up and down at about 5 Hz as your eyes oscillate between trying to compensate for you falling over backwards, but then realize you're not moving and snap back.)"

Aromatic red cedar, used in chests for its antimicrobial properties, has a very strong smell because of the compounds themselves, as well as being in a closed environment. A closed chest will build up the smell, so it's very strong when you open it, but the reaction on the inside is slower than the outside because light and oxygen can accelerate the process."

        "It's important to get the right mindset for understanding evolution, and unfortunately the vagueness of language can sometimes hinder comprehension. Humans are driven by intent. We *choose* to interact with the world, and so it is tempting for us to anthropomorphise various processes and assign intent where it is not warranted. It is important to say, *\"organisms evolve in response to...\"* instead of *\"organisms evolve in order to...\"* I don't know anything about cheetah cubs specifically, but evolution didn't know grey cub hair would scare away lions. What presumably happened is that those cubs that were naturally a little darker (because of ever-present variation) were *statistically* less likely to be eaten and therefore *more likely* to make it to adulthood and spread those very genes that helped them not get eaten. If you keep repeating the process of 'mutated genes that result in a structure or behaviour that bestows a statistical advantage in reproduction get reproduced more often' for millions of years, you see change that appears intentional. Also, sometimes evolutionary pressures provide scaffolding for later ones. For example, and this is pure speculation in order to convey the idea: it could be that the particular long, dense, grey hair had a different reason for evolving (such as better grip for the mother, or protection from weather) and *just happened* to give the added benefit of making lions think twice. Then the evolutionary pressure changed and went in a different direction. The word for this is \"exaptation,\" where an evolved feature later gets appropriated for another purpose. Sometimes we see the results of one type of evolutionary pressure, but what got it started remains a mystery. Unfortunately there will always be gaps in our knowledge of how things *actually* got started.",
        "It doesn't. Just at some time some cheetah were born with grey hair on their backs, and that reduced the chance of being killed by lions. So those cheetah survived and had greyback pups, that survived and had greyback pups and so on. Enough generations in the future and greyback cheetah pups are the norm. So Evolution works like Netflix, it doesn't know what series will be popular, so they throw a lot of stuff against a wall and see what sticks. Popular series will have more views and get more seasons, and not-so-popular ones end up cancelled. Or eaten by lions. Thats the (over)simplified version of Natural Selection.

        "You wanted to know about octopus: their outer layer contains pigment pockets that can be stretched or shrinked to control the overall color. It also contains muscles that creat small bumps, changing texture. Plenty other animals can change color, with different mechanisms, but on a slower rate: anywhere from seconds to days. Unprompted comment: given your list of features, you are thinking about outer defenses. Other options include mucus, poison, spines, fur and camouflage/bright colors. But some of those don't exclude others and can happen simultaneously. Also don't ignore that the skin may offer protection not only from predators, but from the environment itself, so things like cold, radiation, dehydration etc. And it is always a tradeoff, some animal groups go for lighter versions of whatever their group have for protection, or even have not much beyond a thin barrier. Protection costs energy to produce, reduces mobility and may interfere with other capabilities (like breathing through the skin, the octopus color-change, or chemical/tactile sensation) It will really come down to what are the parameters of your simulation if any of these will be relevant. Good luck!",
        "Hmmm...well, that's not a standard way to divide up animals but I think I see what you are getting at... The earliest animals have an outer skin that's just a layer of cells. These pretty much always live where it's damp or underwater, because with no barrier they lose water to evaporation quickly. You can think of a jellyfish or flatworm, things like that. From this starting point, animals have gone different ways. Some developed a cuticle, a tough outer casing that can't grow but has to be shed periodically as the animal grows. Roundworms and tardigrades have this. In arthropods, this cuticle has developed into a full-on exoskeleton, which may in turn be more or less reinforced with calcium and other minerals (crabs have mineralized shells, insects don't, for example) Some developed hard, mineral shells that are secreted by glands in their skin and used for support and protection. Brachiopods, clams, nautilus, and snails are examples of this. Vertebrates have skin made of layers of cells and collagen. Fish developed scales, which come in a variety of different forms. But in general they are either made of bone or other substances and embedded in the skin. In some fish (and other vertebrates) you get large pieces of bone called osteoderms in the skin, forming a sort of armor. Modern amphibians (and many fish) lack scales, having lost them at some point. Reptiles have a totally different sort of scale, made of keratin. Fish scales are embedded within the skin, while reptile scales grow from folds in the outer layer of skin. Hair and feathers both independently originated from reptile scales and are also made of keratin, in this case growing from special structures in the outer layer of the skin. Early feathers probably looked rather hairlike (some feathers still do), but they weren't hair."

What this means is that electrodynamics obeys the superposition principle: the solution in the presence of two combined sources is just the sum of the individual solutions. For the slightly wrong part: electrodynamics is only perfectly linear assuming you know the sources for all space and time. However in real life, the charges and currents are pushed around by electromagnetic forces, so they\u2019re coupled via the Lorentz force law.

Using this definition and assume electronic levels are occupied according to a Fermi-Dirac distribution, then you find that as you take the limit T \u2192 0, then the chemical potential goes towards the center of the gap. It would be a strange choice if you chose a definition such that the chemical potential is discontinuous at T=0, jumping directly from the valence band top (or conduction band bottom) and then to the center of the gap. The Fermi level is a thermodynamic quantity - it is only useful in the thermodynamic limit: large number of particles, finite temperature, etc. If you want to describe a system at *exactly* T=0 you don't need statistical mechanics/thermodynamics and should just avoid using such concepts as chemical potential and instead just use \"valence band maximum\", \"conduction band minimum\", etc."

        "Over reduction is very common with esters because the aldehyde product is more reactive than the ester starting material. Preventing it requires preventing the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate that forms the aldehyde. This can be done with a strong chelating metal complex which occurs when DIBALH is used. It often doesn\u2019t work, though. The same is true for carboxylic acids assuming you use a reducing agent strong enough to reduce the carboxylate. Acyl chlorides, however, are much more reactive than aldehydes so it is a bit easier to prevent over reduction by controlling the reaction temperature, time, and using a less reactive reducing agent. I bet you can do Lewis base catalyzed reductions as well but I haven\u2019t checked so don\u2019t quote me. Nitriles are very easy to reduce to the aldehyde without any over reduction because the first reduction produces a deprotonated imine with a negative charge on the nitrogen rather than the aldehyde itself. This negative charge makes this intermediate very unreactive to further reduction because that would necessarily produce a doubly deprotonated amine with a -2 charge, very high energy. Once all the nitriles are reduced to imine anions, you add water to the reaction. This both quenches any leftover reducing agents and protonates + hydrolyzes the imine to form the aldehyde. But since the reducing agent is now gone it does not get reduced further."

The trick question professors love is comparing oxygen and sulfur. MeO- is more basic but LESS nucleophilic than MeS-, because S is less electronegative than O and so more willing to let its electrons participate in the reaction. Another thing you want to consider is steric hindrance. If you have a very bulky base like DBU, it's sometimes called a non-nucleophilic base because it's too hindered to do reactions but can still remove a proton, which is useful for something like elimination reactions.",
        "It has a lot to do with electron density. For example let's talk about an anion oxygen bonded to another atom (R-O^- ). We know that an R group with a lot of electron withdrawing components can stabilize an extra electron quite easily. This is what results in the high stability of a sulfate ion, which is a very poor nucleophile. Now on the other hand if we have an R group with a lot of electron donors (eg. a secondary alkyl chain like isopropyl), then it is highly destabilized, due to receiving electrons from being an anion and getting electron density from the alkyl chain. This means that the anion is unstable and would love to give up some electrons, resulting in it easily giving up the negative charge and becoming alkylated by an electrophile. You can think of H^+ as being the most simple electrophile and as such a good nucleophile is also a good base. This can be applied in reverse. Strong acids and their derivatives are strong electrophiles (alkyl iodide vs Hydrogen iodide)."

These things are dissolved in water and expelled as urine. (digression: that's not the only reason you need water; you also need to replenish what you use by respiration -- as water wapor, and by perspiration -- a human speciality used to regulate heat; end of digression) When you drink plain water, you gain just water to mix with the wastes/unwanted chemicals to expel. When you drink water mixed with stuff, you acquire that, _plus_ more of the things you want to expel. It's clearly less effective!

      "output": [
        "This is actually a deep and interesting question. You will often see the claim that energy is only conserved \"on average\" in QM or that the act of measuring somehow exchanges energy with the system, neither of which are (necessarily) true (see e.g. At the core is the principle of an energy superposition. At first glance, this kind of state seems natural enough. However, to show a violation of energy conservation, you should start with an amount E, and then later show the presence of a different amount, E'. As it turns out, there is no way to create a pure, coherent superposition of energy eigenstates from a fixed amount of energy E, using only unitary evolution (the Schr\u00f6dinger equation). This suggests that there is a kind of super-selection principle, completely forbidding the creation of such states. The \\*only\\* way to get an energy superposition is to prepare it with a classical system (in which we do not keep track of the energy). Given this, how can we ever justify writing down such superposition states (something that is routinely done from the very first intro courses in QM)? This issue has been discussed much in the literature in different contexts. A nice example is the issue of whether coherent optical states actually exist . They are exactly superposition states of photon number (energy), and there is no way to create them from a well-defined amount of energy in a way that they are not entangled with the system that created them. The resolution to this issue, which I agree with, is nicely explained in this paper . They argue that whether you consider energy superpositions possible, is a matter of convention. It boils down to what kind of clock you compare your quantum state with. This is actually an old idea, first proposed by Arahonov and Susskind . So the answer is that energy is perfectly conserved in QM. If you start with an amount E, and model the preparation quantum mechanically, you will never measure an amount different from E. If this was not the case, surely someone would have done an experiment to observe this (and I do not believe the Carroll experiment from the first link is one such experiment - it is impossible to create the superposition state they use with a well-defined amount of energy).",
        "I will try to keep my opinion as simple as possible. The measurement interaction is actually an \"external\" interaction. It is not part of the hamiltonian, it is not described by a potential or a hermitian operator. Actually, measurement cannot be described in Copenhagen interpretation. When you are measuring something, the system under measurement is interacting with the measuring apparata. Think about this: the system is interacting with the \"outside world\". The system is exchanging information and energy with the apparata. There is no conservation of energy because something is \"going out\" of the system. It is not a closed system."

T cells are the ones that go after things that don't have MHCs. They don't really know until they float around and try binding to the outer edge. There is no fine-tuned \"drone-like\" process here.

First of all, in the above you seem to to have turned a multiplication into a subtraction (`1/2` *minus* rather than multiplied by) instead of rendering that entire factor negative (`-(1/2 * [...])`), which is what you should do. Correcting for that we get `-58.65` and `-21,630.2` for `x`; the second solution is of course not possible, as it would require negative time. However, there's a problem with your formula for `t` too; since you're defining positive upward, the displacement is negative, so you need to add the `\u0394x/343` term instead (i.e. `t = 4.2 + \u0394x/343`). You could have subtracted the absolute value instead too, but it's simpler to just change the sign there. When you fix that too, you get `-48.27` and `-26,282.9` as values for `x`, again with the latter not being a proper solution due to requiring negative time.

These advantages will scale \u2013 the longer the body, the more gametes for example. But I think there is also an element of path dependency here. If you are a segmented animal, the 'easiest' way to increase in size is to just grow more segments. This is something that can easily be achieved through mutations in one or a few genes. Growing larger through increasing in girth would also result in things like a higher capacity for gamete production. But it would also, beyond a certain point, mean that you also have to evolve more complex systems for circulation and gas exchange which is a much more complex thing to do than just adding an extra segment or two. The ratio between surface and volume will change substantially if an animal like a centipede gets thicker, but will change very little it it gets longer."

The dye you used is based off Allura Red AC (Red 40) . Not the most light stable dye in the world. Find a local dye commercial (industrial) supplier of dyes and ask them for a light-stable red dye powder - it will be 100 times stronger that what you are currently using and more light-fast. Are all the bottles made of the same material? Glass, PET, crystal? Different materials pass different wavelengths of light - so some may occlude UV and others may pass UV. Did you use the same mica - type and quantity - in all of the bottles? Commercial \"Micas\" are usually coated titanium dixode - titanium dioxide is a photocatalyst and has been used to speed up photodegradation of dyes. If you used, for example, an ultrafine white pearl mica (high surface area) and a bottle that happens to pass significant amounts of UV you may have created a small photoreactor - and while direct sunlight would make it fade faster, other light sources (e.g. compact fluorescent tubes) can emit UV. My suggestion would be to replicate the issue - as the faded bottle is presumably of no use, clean it out, refill it with the same mixture and see if it happens again. Use a control (e.g. a bottle that hasn't degraded) and place them together in the same conditions to check for variation. In terms of stopping the problem from occuring, I'd start with adding a UV absorber +/or inhibitor to the system. Commercially, BASF Tinuvin 9945-DW is a broad spectrum UV inhibitor/absorber for water based systems - see if you have a local water based paints manufacturer, they may have access to some or may be able to request a sample for you - it's used at fairly low levels so a sample could last you a long time. &#x200B; Edit: to add dye comment."

        "I could answer this question more precisely if you provide a specific location and fish species, but in general there are two main routes that fish get into isolated bodies of water First, isolated bodies of water are rarely isolated on long time scales. Streams shift and move, floods happen, etc. This lets fish move across the landscape. In northern North America, the retreat of the glaciers caused huge shifts in the distribution of water across the landscape. Gigantic meltwater lakes formed and drained as the glaciers melted, and fish were left behind in the remnant lakes and ponds. See, for example, [this map] of Lake Agassiz and Lake Ojibway) Second, people are absolutely mad about stocking fish in every single body of water they can find. Canada has a network of hatcheries that raise trout for stocking in ponds and lakes, including fairly remote ones. For example, the state of Alberta stocks [about 2.1 million trout each year into 240 bodies of water], and Nova Scotia has three hatcheries that stock out about [1.7 million trout per year]. And that's just the public stocking system for public waters. People also buy trout for their farm ponds from private hatcheries. Most likely, you are looking at one of those two factors at play.",
        "As u/atomfullerene points out, rivers change course, which can either isolate a body of water, or connect it. And floods intermittently connect rivers, especially in lowlands (think the Gulf Coast of Texas or the Atlantic plains of Honduras). There's an additional mechanism that has long been postulated but is very hard to demonstrate: bird-assisted dispersal. Fish eggs are sticky, and in principle should be able to survive a short flight stuck to a duck's foot or feathers. A recent study ( found that if ducks eat carp eggs, some of them can survive the entire digestive tract.

The other form of hermaphrodites, sequential hermaphrodites, sometimes show sexual dimorphism. In this case the dimorphism comes before the sex.

There are no rats wielding capybara-sized incisors. Dunkeosteous may have had an oversized mouth to crack shells of slow-moving armoured creatures, but sharks are specifically evolved for speed. Sure, some species of shark may have specialised in eating slow-but-tough prey, but I think their teeth would have changed an awful lot more than *still-as-pointy-only-bigger*.

The water-hating part of the soap wants to get away from the water. If the virus is on a person's hands, that water-hating tail is drawn to that fatty layer. When you lather your hands and physically rub, it forms micelles, which are pockets that trap and remove handfuls of harmful germs, chemicals, and dirt from the surface.

The average of 4A^2 and 0 is 2A^2 , which is cheating, but if you actually calculate the most likely energy of two waves added with random phases, it\u2019s twice the energy of each one.

With that assumption and with definition of a conductor (and metals are conductors) we know that it possess freely flowing charge. If there were an electric field inside the conductor then it must follow that there's a force acting on charge which means charges are in motion. However, we just said we're dealing with electrostatics. So charges cannot move, they're stationary. But that means there must be no net force acting on them form which follow there most be no electric field. Now comes Gauss's law. If you apply it to the inside of an conductor it yields zero charge inside. That means all charge inside the conductor must have flown to the surface.

For example: 'animal' and 'plant' are specific words for kingdoms of life on this planet. It's important to understand that, since biology is very very messy and complex, as are human languages, many words are used in a wide range of contexts and levels. Commonly used words like \"tree\" and \"fish\" and \"bug\" have very ambiguous meanings. Swordfish, hagfish, shellfish, cuttlefish, starfish, crayfish and jellyfish are hardly a single group. We say \"a forest of bamboo trees\" but bamboo is more closely related to grass than redwoods. 'Bug' could be used to refer to all small terrestrial arthropods (including insects, myriapods, and arachnids), or it could purely be a synonym of insect, or it could be restricted to the subset of insects that includes cicadas and aphids (hemiptera). I think if we ever found multicellular life, we would use these terms in their vaguest, broadest sense. There would of course be very strict scientific taxonomy, and different biochemistries would be grouped according to how similar they were and what mechanisms that had in common. Carbon and non-carbon based life would be one major dichotomy, but there would be many others. However, for everyday usage, people would still use common terrestrial words to roughly refer to similarish groups on other worlds. We would still use 'animal' and 'plant' and 'tree' and 'fish' and 'bug' for the life-forms we find elsewhere if they made sense.",

Birds would be anything that fly and has wings - birds, bats and flying squirrels. Mammals would be anything that has hair and produce milk, and so on. Today, biologists base their classifications on phylogeny. A group can only be formed if their monophily can be attested - it must include the last common ancestor of the representatives of the group and all of its descendants. With that in mind, if a naturalist of the past had ever found a multicellular alien that produced some form of milk and had its body covered in hair, it would definitely be classified as a mammal. Under modern cladystics though, it would be very difficult to believe that an alien from another star system shares the same 300 million year old ancestor with Earth's mammals, so it would be classified as something entirely different despite their similarities."

This equilibrium is given by [Henry's Law]. The reason why the CO\u2082 leaves the drink when you expose it to air, is that the partial pressure of CO\u2082 in our atmosphere is very low - only 0.0004 atm. If you crack open a bottle and seal it again, the initial opening would have depressurized the headspace and reduced the CO\u2082 partial pressure down to 0.0004 atm; the subsequent bubbling of CO\u2082 out of the drink and into this headspace then slowly replenishes the partial pressure of CO\u2082, until the equilibrium is reestablished (as you've deduced) but this time at a lower concentration than before. The exact equilibrium partial pressure is a function of multiple things, including temperature, the composition of the drink, and the concentration of CO\u2082 needed for that 'fizziness'. But using the properties of water at 25\u00b0C and the concentration of CO\u2082 inside Coca-Cola (~0.1 mol/L), we get an equilibrium partial pressure of ~3 atm.

The algebra looks the same except that the dot product (x dot y) = x1y1 + x2y2 has a minus sign on one of the terms, e.g. x1y1 - x2y2 This happens to align exactly with the Minkowski metric of special relativity so in a surprising twist hyperbolic geometry is just as fundamental to describing space-time as Euclidean geometry is to describing space.",
        "Here\u2019s something really cool: There is an number system called the [split-complex numbers], which are numbers of the form, a + bj Where a, b are real numbers and j is an imaginary unit which squares to 1, so j^2 = 1, however j is not equal to 1 or -1. This algebra has it\u2019s own version of Euler\u2019s formula which you can derive with Taylor series in the same manner as the regular one, e^\u03c6j = cosh(\u03c6) + sinh(\u03c6) * j Just like the regular Euler\u2019s formula, but with hyperbolic trig functions. While regular trig functions give you the x, y coordinates of a point on the unit circle, hyperbolic trig functions give you the x, y coordinates of a point on the unit hyperbola. While applying the operator e^\u03b8i to a complex number pushes it \u03b8 radians around the circle which it lies on, applying e^\u03c6j to a split-complex number pushes it by a hyperbolic angle of \u03c6 along the hyperbola that it lies on, which is called a hyperbolic rotation. Now we can consider special relativity in 1+1 dimensions, so 1 spatial dimension and time. We can encode an event into a split-complex number like so: r = ct + xj So the time coordinate is the real part, and the spatial coordinate is the imaginary part. Now we can take some velocity v, and define a hyperbolic angle \u03c6 like so, tanh(\u03c6) = \u03b2 = v / c In which case we will have cosh(\u03c6) = \u03b3, and sinh(\u03c6) = \u03b3\u03b2, where \u03b3 = 1 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2^(2)) as usual. (You can work this out with hyperbolic trig identities). And finally if we apply the operator e^-\u03c6j to an event we get, e^(-\u03c6j) * r = (\u03b3 - \u03b3\u03b2j) * (ct + xj) = \u03b3ct + \u03b3xj - \u03b3\u03b2ctj - \u03b3\u03b2x = \u03b3(ct - \u03b2x) + \u03b3(x - \u03b2ct)j = ct\u2019 + x\u2019j = r\u2019 Not sure if you recognize it but that is a Lorentz boost, Lorentz boosts are hyperbolic rotations! The hyperbolic angle \u03c6 would be the rapidity of the boost. Something nice about rapidities is that they are additive unlike regular velocity, so the composition of two Lorentz boosts with rapidities \u03c61 and \u03c62 results in a Lorentz boost with rapidity \u03c63 = \u03c61 + \u03c62. Which gives you an alternate way to write the relativistic velocity addition formula: tanh^(-1)(\u03b23) = tanh^(-1)(\u03b21) + tanh^(-1)(\u03b22) So hyperbolic functions are not just of mathematical interest, but they are also baked directly into special relativity. [Here\u2019s] a video going over the derivation in a little more detail if you\u2019re interested. This can also be generalized to 3+1 dimensions with Clifford/geometric algebra, although the situation becomes a little more complicated."

Plants, on the other hand, get their energy from the sun. And they use that energy to make all the chemicals they need for life out of more elemental components. If a plant needs amino acids, for example, it doesn't absorb complete amino acids. It takes in nitrogen, water, and CO2, and use those to synthesize new amino acids from scratch. The reason animal waste is waste is that it's the broken down remnants of whatever an animal has previously used or can't use. It's got nitrogen and phosphorous and potassium and various other elements that are not in a form animals can get at them....but are in a form very useful to plants, because the plants can use energy from the sun to rebuild these elements into more DNA and protein and etc. In a way, it's a bit like how people breathe in Oxygen and eat sugars, and breathe out CO2, but plants take in CO2 and produce sugar and oxygen."

Why did the big bang happen? Maybe there is a god that did it, maybe not. In my opinion God is not a good answer because it makes the beginning that much more complicated. Where does god come from is the obvious question.

To avoid an infinite regression we'd have to accept the possibility that something can appear designed while not requiring a designer. 2.

What that evidence looks like is, at a given locus, a higher rate of mutations that change the sequence of a protein than mutations that leave the protein the same. Here's an example suggesting that body mass and age at first childbirth are evolutionarily relevant traits that affect the frequency of alleles in the human gene pool: Going a little farther back, there is strong evidence for natural selection in human populations: malaria resistance, lactase persistence (the ability to digest milk in adults), and resistance to an immunodeficiency virus that had the unfortunate side effect of making us more vulnerable to HIV thousands of years later. You're right that most of the changes in human phenotype that we've observed over the last couple of centuries are environmental. People are taller mostly because they eat more fat and protein as children. People are smarter mostly because they receive more schooling. People have fewer children because they have access to birth control. It's hard to predict how changes in culture will change human gene pools, though, because the changes are so rapid that the effect on the gene pool of any cultural shift might be quite fleeting (only a generation or two). These things might become obvious in retrospect, but they're very hard to predict. The fact that more people from different populations are able to mix, marry, and reproduce might be an interesting factor. This will have the effect of increasing a quantity called effective population size, which is a measure of dispersion of alleles in a population. A simple way to think about it is it generates more possible combinations of gene variants, so that more of the theoretically possible genotypes actually exist. That creates new opportunities for natural selection in the future, although again, the specific effect is very hard to predict."

Diffusion happens between two liquids or gases which can move freely through a space, while diffusion only happens in liquids and includes a semi-permeable membrane which only allows certain molecules to move through (Like a cell membrane).

      "output": [
        "Lets expand the perspective to all mammals. In mammals, males are in general bigger and stronger than females. Why? The short answer is that in most species one male reproduces with more than one female, so there is a surplus of males and a scarcity of females. So males have to compete against other males for access to the females. One common way to do it is to be bigger and stronger than the rest. Being bigger and stronger is an advantage that comes with a huge cost energetically speaking. Males need to eat more, and usually takes them more time to reach sexual maturity. Why would females incur in such costs when they don't need to compete in the same way males do? This is a simplified version of a general trend we see in mammals. Each species is a world in itself, females compete too, not all males compete by being bigger, etc. There are many exceptions to this rule, but it's a useful generalization to understand sex differences in size and strenght.",

This tells you the instantaneous amount of power you'd need to continue applying a force F to the object once it's reached velocity v. But during the acceleration, the object is moving slower than v, so the power is less than Fv. To calculate the average power that way, you need to use the velocity as a function of time v(t) and find the average of Fv(t)\u2014that's how much power is being used at time t.

      "output": [
        "Ahh yes, this is a classic paradox that come up somewhat often on this forum. The problem is basically a variation of the [Ehrenfest paradox]. The resolution is that relativity principle ensures that perfectly rigid objects can't exist. In practice a rod is made of atoms. When you push/pull the atoms at one end of the rod, the atoms move slightly which disturbs the electrostatic equilibrium between those atoms and the neighboring atoms (atoms interact through electromagnetic forces). This disturbance doesn't happen instantly. The change in the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, but since atoms have mass, it takes some time for them to accelerate and react to the change in the electromagnetic field. The maximum speed you can move the atoms in a material such that the overall structure is preserved (the material doesn't break) turns out to be equal to the speed of sound in the object. The speed of sound is exactly the speed at which a harmonic displacement propagates in the material. So when you start to swing your rod, the rod will bend and the other end will \"lag behind\" a bit. As you swing it faster and faster it will bend more and more, in the end turning the rod into a spiral or at least bending so much that it breaks or snaps. No part of the rod will ever reach the speed of light.",

If I have a powerful laser that can shine beam onto the moon, if I flick the laser really quick, surely it must be going faster than the speed of light, right? No, it'll still take time. You can Google the image and thought experiment if you want to understand more, but basically you would be making a sort of \"light whip\" shape that LOOKS like it's faster than light, but it's not. If light can't do it, physical material definitely can't",
        "The answers to this question miss the point. Speed of sound in the rod limits not how fast you can rotate the rod but how fast you can *change the angular velocity of the rod*. If you try and do it fast then the rod will bend because there are no rigid bodies. That is true. OK, but what if you have a very long time to do this experiment? And you have a magic rod which has enough tensile strength lets say, and you probably balance it so you do not have to pull on it. Maybe it is actually a big disk which you are very, very slowly spinning up. Perhaps you have billions of years to spin it up. Now what goes wrong? Well, it is simple: to do this the end of the rod, or the circumference of the disk, must move very very quickly. Well, what is the kinetic energy of this thing at the end of the disk? It is (1 - \u03b3)mc^(2), if the thing has mass m, where \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1-v^(2)/c^(2)) in the usual way. Well, it is easy to see that this diverges as the speed of the mass at the end of the rod approaches c. That is what stops you."

        "Okay so the first thing you need to know is about lorentz transformations. In physics you can use different coordinate systems to describe a situation, and it should not matter what coordinate system you use - the results should all convert to one another nicely and not contradict. The lorentz transformation is a function that converts points between these coordinate systems. So on an ordinary four-vector, like velocity (vt,vx,vy,vz), the lorentz transformation converts it to a new coordinate system using some formula. This formula is called the \"vector representation\". There are other different sets of important numbers, such as momentum and angular momentum. It was found early on in the history of quantum mechanics that if you put an electron in a magnetic field is behaves as if it had angular momentum and a magnetic moment. This was weird because if you interpret it as a point particle, that makes no sense. But it turns out, each particle has a similar property to angular momentum, which behaves in a similar way in electromagnetism as a spinning disk of charge. It's not quite the same, but for that reason we called it spin. Depending on the type of particle, spin can be determined using a different number of variables. We put these variables into a vector, which is called a spinor. For example, an electron is said to have spin 1/2. This means we use two complex variables s1 and s2, and the spin of the electron is described by the vector (s1, s2). What makes this vector special is that when you change coordinates using a lorentz transformation, the formulas for the new variables are different from what you are used to. The new formulas are called the \"spin representation\". Depending on the magnitude of the spin of the particle (i.e. 1/2 or 1 or 3/2, etc.) you use a different spin representation, i.e. a different set of formulas, and the number of elements of the spinor is different.",
        "If a set of three mutually perpendicular vectors (a \"frame\") rotates in some manner, you can get an idea of the rotation that occurred by comparing the original frame to the rotated frame. However, if the rotated frame looks just like the original frame, it's impossible to tell whether a rotation of 360 degrees or a rotation of 0 degrees (no rotation) took place by just comparing the rotated and original frames. Spinors are things that can be used in place of vectors that allow you to make this distinction between a rotation of 360 degrees and no rotation at all, in the sense that rotating a spinor by 360 degrees gives you a spinor which is different from the original spinor. More generally, spinors give you a way of distinguishing rotations which cannot be continuously deformed into each other (technically, rotations which are not homotopic to each other). There's much more that can be said here such as, for example, that a 720 degree rotation is homotopic to no rotation at all (see: the [plate trick] - which is related to the fact that the spins of particles are always integer multiples of 1/2, but that should give you rough idea of what spinors do."

It could be that the universe was there as a singularity for an immeasurable long period of \"time\" until it suddenly became unstable and erupted into the expanding universe we know now, but, as we don't fully understand how the laws of physics worked before/at the big bang, the concept of \"time\" is unclear to us in that context as well.",

One of the things we like to do in physics is separate the term *Cosmos* from the term *Universe.* The former is \"everything that ever was and ever can be, regardless of if we understand it\" and the later is \"all that exists that we can observe and measure.\" One of the most common responses to the question \"what happened before the big bang?\" is the following: \"this question is akin to asking 'what's north of the north pole?\" This is because we have a pretty good understanding of Space-time, which we like to think of as the stage in which all of physical reality (read: physical objects in motion) plays out on. Physics is notorious for being the scientific discipline that inspires the most... let's call it.... \\*mimics a deep hit from a joint\\* mindbending, multi-verse, parallel universe, quantum, simulation, energy=mass, time travel, crazy shit man!!!! But physics as a science is actually REALLY simple... Physics is the scientific study of motion. Physics = \"what are things made of and why do they move?\" THAT'S IT! So, the way we break down your question is... \"Was the big bang (an event that triggered a lot of motion) the beginning of our Universe but not the Cosmos? Or, was it the beginning of our Universe but not the beginning of the Cosmos? Or, was it not the beginning of either?\" In cosmology (read: the science of the physics of everything that ever was), we have many different theoretical models that are both cyclical and non cyclical. A cyclical cosmology model posits that the Universe we live in today might not be the first Universe to have existed. Further, if our Universe IS the first universe to have existed, then it won't be the last after it reaches some kind of maximal state (e.g. \"the big rip\" or \"the big collapse\"). But we also have theoretical models that predict this is indeed the first Universe to exist, and it might be the last! Feels weird, right? How does everything come from nothing? Surprisingly enough in inflationary cosmology, triggering the big bang doesn't require much beyond simple mass. In a famous paper by MIT's Alan Guth (the father of inflationary cosmology), it was discovered that under certain conditions, you need about 10kg worth of mass to create a big bang. That's it! Adding to this mystery is the observable fact that, today, our best scientific observations of the Universe are all in near-unanimous agreement that the total energy of the Universe (energy = the capacity to cause motion; it's really that simple) is equal to EXACTLY ZERO! This means that the Universe not existing (energy = 0) is mathematically the same as the Universe existing (total net energy = 0). Pretty wild!

The options: - something has always existed - at one point there was nothing, then something happened to that nothing, and then there was something. - nothing exists currently and you're just imagining things In the first case, the universe is just the thing that always existed in one form or another. In the second one, it is logically possible that the universe started at some finite point in the past, but the nothingness that was there before was inherently not true nothingness, or else there wouldn't have been anything that could have happened to trigger the known universe to begin (but also nothing logically preventing such an occurrence either). In that case the Time that started with the universe is separate and isolated measurement of things within the universe and doesn't have much relation to the nothingness, so it's kind of inappropriate to try to apply it to things that happened before the start. Both infinity and 0 are probably equally accurate, in that there was an infinite amount of time that passed in the nothingness and it's still infinitely expanding into the future. But also, no time passed because time doesn't really exist in nothingness and the infinity of non-existence is similar to the infinite anount of fractional numbers between 0 and 1. In the 3rd case you need to put the pipe down and go for a walk.",

A more pertinent question might be 'how is it possible for the universe to be infinite in spatial extent?'. Well, our current models do allow for such universes and indeed when we go out and do measurements it looks as if it may very well be infinite in spatial extent. So, well, we can look at the maths of this and it all works fine.

      "output": [
        "The \"stickiness\" or adhesion of a surface depends primarily on interactions between molecules. These are called intermolecular forces. These interactions (broadly) arise from electromagnetic interactions between the electrons of neighboring molecules. These forces can be net attractive or repulsive. They can occur between the same molecule or different molecules. These interactions between a molecule and itself govern properties like boiling point and viscosity of molecules. For example, methane, CH4 (a one-carbon \"chain\") is a small molecule with little intermolecular forces. The molecules can't \"stick\" together very well, so methane exists as a gas. Hexane, a 6-carbon chain is larger which allows these attractive forces to build up more. Hexane can interact with itself better than methane, and exists as a liquid. These forces also govern things like solubility and miscibility of different substances. \"Non-stick\" substances have weak potential for intermolecular forces which mean they won't interact strongly with themselves *or* other molecules. Teflon, for example, is a polymer made up of many very long, high molecular weight chains of CF2 groups. The carbon-fluorine bond is very strong but has weak intermolecular forces. Teflon also has the advantage of having a very rigid macromolecular structure; it is composed of stacks of tightly-packed, long, rigid chains of CF2 groups. This serves to prevent effective contact between Teflon and large molecules like the proteins in an egg."

Ok, but it only has that because it's also got one more proton on its nucleus. So that atom is neutral, as are the silicon atoms it's bonded to. The effect the dopant has on the material's energy bands, however, causes there to now be a partially filled band, which makes the material conductive, whereas before doping, all of the bands in the pure silicon we're either completely full or completely empty, which caused it to be insulating before the doping.",
        "The dopants themselves aren\u2019t charged, adding the dopants changes whether the valence or conductions bands are filled/empty. Add an n-type dopant and it means that there are electrons in the conduction band that can flow, add a p-type dopant and then their is a lack of electron in the valence band, which can also move. But this is separate from the charge neutrality/balance",
        "Think about what we are doping. We are not adding individual electrons/protons. We add a **neutral** donor/acceptor atom. There's no reason why the end product (extrinsic semiconductor) should be charged. Lets take an N type and prove this (the same argument can be applied for p type too). There's two ways why you could think that the semiconductor is charged. 1. You could say an extra electron is introduced into silicon lattice when the donor atom is introduced,right? So that should mean an extra negative charge? Note that even though u effectively add an electron, the phosphorus or whatever element u are adding has an equal number of protons in its nucleus. Thus the whole thing remains neutral. 2. You could say when the electron moves to the neighbouring silicon atom,it has an extra negative charge. So this should mean the material is negatively charged? For every electron that the phosphor atoms donate to the neighbour silicon, the phosphor atoms acquires a positive charge (since they originally had 15p and 15e and now only have 15p and 14e) making the whole thing neutral.

If the behavior depends very sensitively on the specific boundary conditions, then either your box size is too small or the features you\u2019re interested in are truly macroscopic (in which case I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if such a thermodynamic treatment would fail). For something like a condensed matter system, your lattice contains a huge number of atoms. We expect the atoms to only have short-ranged interactions (nearest neighbor, for example). Your choice in bondage conditions are going mostly effect the atoms closest to the boundary; beyond that, the effect should dissipate in the bulk.

If you e.g. place a satellite at Lagrange point 1 (L1), which is roughly 1% of the distance to our sun from Earth, then it will remain there as viewed from us. In other words, even when we've completed exactly half an orbit around the sun, then that satellite will also have completed exactly the same part of the orbit, remaining exactly in between us and the sun. Such points can be useful for many different reasons. For example, having satellites that monitor space weather at L1, which we do indeed have, is useful because they'll always remain in the exact same direction from the sun as us; in other words, if they see a CME headed straight for themselves, then we know it's also headed straight for us, since we're all in a straight line.",

Neutrinos have so little mass that no one has ever observed a right handed neutrino. In fact, we know that they have mass thanks to flavour oscillations, not because we have measured it.",
        "There are several aspects to this. First, neutrinos only interact through the weak interaction that only couples to the left-chiral components of particles. This is true for all particles, but all other particles can be produced through the electromagnetic or strong interactions, whereas for neutrinos we can only produce or detect the left handed components. Second, as already mentioned the neutrino masses are so tiny that the nonconservation of chirality can be neglected. Then, we don't know the precise nature of neutrino masses yet. They could be of the same nature as that of the other fermions (so-called Dirac masses), with a right-handed component of the neutrino that is completely noninteracting. Alternatively, the neutrinos could be so-called Majorana particles where the right-handed component is the antiparticle of the left-handed neutrino. Since the Dirac or Majorana nature of the neutrinos is not yet decided expirementally and since the masses can be usually neglected e.g. in collider physics, in introductions to the standard model the neutrinos are usually initially treated as massless and only the left-handed component is included."

Think of another ticking clock as a second fence with the same spacing between its fenceposts. Now, if they have some relative velocity, the two fences will be angled relative to one another. Perhaps the second post is going north-east, for example, while the first fence is still going north. If you travel along the first fence and look at the other, the second fence's posts seem to be spaced closer together than yours, because you are viewing them from an angle. It's a matter of perspective. They, too, would observe the same thing happening to you. This is what time dilation looks like at constant velocity. Now, what about a round-trip? If a traveler starts at one end of the first fence, walks away from that fence for a while in the northeast direction, then walks back to the same fence going northwest (remember in this example, north-south is time, east-west is space), the total space-time distance that traveler would have taken will be longer than the length of the same fence segment extending straight north. This is why a traveling twin taking a round trip at relativistic speeds will age differently than an earthbound twin, because their respective path lengths through spacetime are different (one is traveling a hypotenuse and then coming back, the other is going straight.) This is a matter of geometry. Now take this analogy in euclidean space and transpose it into minkowski space, which is what the universe really operates on. This requires you to flip some conclusions (fence posts look further apart than normal, rather than closer) and the traveling twin actually takes a shorter path through spacetime than the earth twin, which means he ends up being younger. But it\u2019s still a matter of perspective and geometry. Hope that helped.",

This is not an illusion, but truly physically happens. The laws of physics always conspire to resolve any apparent paradox. For instance, take a line of charges parallel to the change in velocity. In the new frame length contraction means the line of charge is denser and so a greater electric force perpendicular to the line of charge is detected than in the old frame. In the old frame this force is still there but is called the magnetic force instead of the electric force."

This is not true for the person falling into the black hole. They are always moving at a rate less than the speed of light, and so there can be a frame in which they are at rest.",
        "In general relativity, there\u2019s a distinction between what\u2019s happening \u201cglobally\u201d vs. \u201clocally\u201d. Globally here roughly means how things like time dilation, speed, etc. are behaving when you\u2019re far away from the object. For example, in general relativity the speed of light far away doesn\u2019t have to be c. However, the *local* speed of light (e.g. the speed of light that whizzes right past you) will always be c (in vacuum). Likewise for a person falling into a black hole, if you ask what\u2019s happening locally, nothing abrupt actually occurs. The person just falls in past the event horizon without anything strange occurring. Photons don\u2019t have a valid reference frame because they are *always* locally traveling at c regardless of reference frame, so there can\u2019t be a reference frame where they\u2019re at rest."

        "Cookies are something that we as humans created. It's like writing some data on a piece of paper with a URL from the website that gave you that data. You then provide this piece of paper to the website everytime you visit, so that the website can remember who you are, what your preferences are, etc. Except all of this is not on a piece of paper, it's some digital information that your browser takes care of for you. As for the brain, it works in a completely different way and evolved naturally over hundreds of millions of years. There's still a lot we don't know about how the brain works, but the gist of it is the following. Your brain consists of billions upon billions of neurons, each of which is connected to thousands of its neighbours. Each neuron can send a pulse, an electrical signal. Neurons send pulses based on the inputs that they get from their neighbors. For example, a neuron might send pulses itself when it's neighbors are sending a lot of pulses. Or it might only send pulses if it's neighbors are sending few pulses. This depends on how strong the connections between the neurons are. By tweaking these connections (which is basically what learning is, it's the strengthening and weakening of connections between neurons), you can create specific patterns in the firing of these neurons, because one neighbor might make the neuron fire right away, whole another neighbor has very little influence on the firing of that neuron. These patterns are what govern everthing that we do. One pattern makes you move a finger, another pattern makes you think of ice cream, yet another pattern makes you say the phrase \"damn the brain is complicated\" To reiterate: we have a rough idea of how the brain works. Neurons fire pulses which cause other neurons to fire pulses. By connecting them in a certain way, you create patterns, which in the end result in all the things our brain does. Memory is encoded in these connections between neurons. Through a specific set of connections with the right strengths, you can remember \"i like apple pie\" . Cookies, on the other hand, write down symbols on some storage media which we humans have decided means \"this guy likes apple pie\""

      "output": [
        "A few reasons. Digital clocks and software clocks are the same thing \u2014 they\u2019re counting oscillations in a crystal (crystals oscillate at a fixed frequency when a current is supplied). However, no two crystals are identical \u2014 they\u2019re 27MHz +/- e%. That e% may sound small, say 100 ppm, but when counting ticks those errors accumulate and drift. It\u2019s called *clock jitter*. Often a synchronization method is needed to slow or speed up your clock to oscillate around real time, but that means you\u2019re synchronizing to another external clock (like an atomic based time server). Then there\u2019s also the problem that the counter reading the crystal oscillations will skip a tick. It\u2019s infrequent but the ticks pile up and accumulate. Again, an external synchronization is needed. And again you slightly slow up or speed up your counter to try to stay synchronized without missing any beats.",
        "Software clocks only work because your PC has a crystal oscillator built-in to keep track of time. The accuracy of the software clock is ultimately limited by the accuracy of that tiny oscillating crystal and how well it was manufactured. An atomic clock uses intrinsic physically properties of atoms, which are always the same, to create a very precise timing signal, which is much more precise than any mechanical oscillation. You can synchronize your PC clock with an atomic clock via Internet, to reset the long term derivations your not so precise PC clock accumulates. But in short term it's still not as precise and stable as a real atomic clock.",
        "Fundamentally it\u2019s because an atomic clock can measure time using the actual scientific definition of a second. If we define \u201cone second\u201d as \u201cX number of hyperfine transitions of the cesium-133 atom\u201d we can then go and build a clock that counts the hyperfine transitions of the cesium-133 atom (glossing over any number of engineering details of course). The crystal oscillator in a computer is by necessity an approximation.",
        "Clocks work by watching something that happens at a regular frequency. If you can find something that happens once per second then your clock simply watches that thing and moves forward one second every time it happens. Then it\u2019s all about how accurate that thing is. Is it exactly once per second? Or sometimes it\u2019s 0.999 seconds and other times it\u2019s 1.001 seconds? A grandfather clock has a pendulum that swings back and forth at a known rate, but it\u2019s not very accurate because vibrations, breeze, and things like that can affect it. A mechanical watch has a little weighted gear spring bit that works the same way. It swings back and forth at a known rate, but again it\u2019s not very accurate because it gets shaken around a lot and that throws it off. A lot of plug in clocks monitor the frequency in the AC power. In the US the power grid runs at 60Hz, so every 60 cycles they count 1 second. But this is not perfect because that 60Hz changes very slightly when load goes up or down so like all the others, they get wrong over time. That\u2019s also not a true source because it\u2019s not a natural phenomenon - that 60Hz is based on another clock. But it\u2019s interesting and clever, so I included it. A digital watch or the clock in your computer look at a little tiny crystal that vibrates at a known rate. This is more accurate than a pendulum or spring wheel since it doesn\u2019t have big swinging mechanical parts, but it\u2019s still susceptible to small variations in the crystal itself, temperature, and so on. Again, it\u2019s all about finding the most predictable thing you can. That brings us to atomic clocks, which measure vibrations in an atom which happen to be very regular because of the atomic processes involved. In addition to a very stable source, these clocks are also better built than your typical wristwatch or PC clock. They\u2019re kept at precise temperatures and use high quality, special purpose hardware that would be way too expensive and bulky to stick in a consumer wristwatch. You could probably make a similar crystal based clock with temperature controls and expensive hardware and it would be better than your wristwatch, but even a really really good crystal isn\u2019t going to be as precise a source as the atomic decay, so we just go straight for the good stuff instead."

Also has the added benefit of cleaning your hands. 70% IPA is cheaper in comparison to 91% (marginally so), but I'd stick with either of those two for the evaporation time. Glycerin is commonly added into products for it's moisturizing/humectant properties, and I think it's not common in liquid chalks specifically because of that reason. Glycerin is more helpful in moisturizing *after* climbing. The liquid chalk you mention in your 4th point has the hydroxypropyl guar to thicken (helpful if you don't want runny liquid chalk that spills easily) and citric acid is likely a preservative. You can probably skip citric acid if you're mixing a little at a time, and you could use a similar food-grade gum to thicken at home."

      "output": [
        "Most all of it has to do with valence/electronegativity or resonance. Valence/electronegativity is for inorganic reagents and resonance is for organic reagents. Organic reagents are more cut and dry so we will start with those. Carbon always has 4 bonds except in some very rare cases so the stability of a specific state of a molecule relative to the others is the most important factor. One common example is benzoquinone/hydroquinone. Hydroquinone is easily oxidized to benzoquinone and vice versa because the hydroxyls can tautomerize into a keto group on a partially hydrogenated aromatic ring. This ring is relatively unstable as aromatic rings are much more stable; this causes the ring to easily give up electrons to enter a more stable state. This is similar for aldehydes and ketones as they have a similar form of resonance that allows them to tautomerize into vinyl alcohols which are quite unstable in general. As far as inorganic chemicals go, it is more complex yet more simple. The inert pair effect results in most classic metal oxidizing agents (eg, Lead (iv), mercury (II)). This effect basically means that any of the elements effected by it can exist in the normal full shell state but is quite unstable in this state and would much rather have 2 more electrons to itself to make a lone pair (the infamous inert pair as these electrons tend to be unreactive). For many inorganic oxidizers you have to consider the electronegativity and the valence of the element. Even though elements are stable all the way up to 8 bonds, they are usually not \"happy\" in this state and will quickly try to form electron pairs rather than bonds and so steal electrons from whatever they can. Anything above 4 bonds is considered a potential oxidizer. Electron configuration also plays a role here as most transition metals have a configuration of S2 D(some number). This means they all have a stable +2 state, except the elements that have different configurations. These elements include silver, gold, and palladium. Palladium retains a stable +2 for some interesting reasons but silver and gold have a S1 configuration which makes them stable in the +1 state. Most elements want to be like their nearest noble gas whether that means giving up electrons to be like their lighter neighbor or accepting electrons to be like their heavier counterparts. This caps out at 8 electrons given up/taken (at 8 bonds the line between losing or gaining electrons is very blurry and all bonds are covalent). For example iodine wants to gain 1 electron to have a full shell, while vanadium wants to give up 5 to have a full shell. The first row of the transition metals and of the main group (different rows but both the first of their specific group) have very small sizes and high electronegativity and so love to have electrons and will most often be stable only in lower valance states. At a half filled shell these elements are also quite stable so they tend to be stable in strange valances like iron which is stable at +2 (like all transition metals) and +3 (which puts it at a half filled shell). But for iron the +3 is oxidizing because of how small the molecule is and how electronegative it is. Larger and less electronegative atoms lose electrons easier while smaller and more electronegative atoms gain electrons easier.",
        "The other answer is great, but there is also not a single overall structure that can be followed. There are so many factors that influence oxidising/reducing power. I have used vitamin C to reduce gold from aqueous solutions, but in DMF or DMSO it no longer works. I have observed concentrations too low or high preventing a typical oxidation/reduction reaction from occuring as well! Reduction/oxidation potentials are incredibly variable things that can be engineered."

        "I am somewhat of an unorthodox case. I used to despise school and mathematics because I couldn't focus, and no matter how hard I tried, it just didn't make sense. I also couldn't see its relevance to my future. Essentially, I coasted through school all the way to high school, doing just the bare minimum. Since I've always been generally intelligent and a quick learner, I knew I could cram before exams, so why bother paying attention in class when I could do other things, that I enjoyed? When I started high school, I became interested in mind-altering substances, both the science behind them and experimenting with the drugs themselves. When my mom found out that I smoked weed, I eventually ended up getting diagnosed with ADHD and autism, which explained my struggle to fit in and focus in school. I have always found science fascinating, but my experiments with psychedelics, especially, led me to develop a more philosophical mindset. I recall a specific LSD trip where I was overwhelmed by patterns and small \"black holes\" in my vision, twisting inward. When I closed my eyes, I saw figures and shapes that seemed to have more than three dimensions, which I cannot possibly describe. This led me into a deep existential amazement and awe. It was as if I could feel all the individual atoms in my body \"vibrating\" with a warm, fuzzy feeling of pure euphoria. This experience flipped a switch in my brain, and I decided to try to learn mathematics to properly understand the universe around me. When I started, my knowledge extended only to the order of operations and very basic algebra. Within two years, I had taught myself up to differential geometry, learning just the bare minimum of the prerequisites required to understand and play around with the Einstein field equations in general relativity. Both special and general relativity have always intrigued me the most. As a child, I often thought about what one would see if one could travel at the speed of light, and I spent a lot of time thinking about gravity as well, though I never knew the mathematics to even understand Newtonian gravity. Eventually, I decided to pursue a formal degree in theoretical physics. This decision was not driven by a desire to work in academia but by a genuine fascination and eagerness to learn as much as possible about the universe.

Then I randomly started learning about chaos theory, complex systems, and some exotic fluid mechanical phenomena, and realized what physics actually is and what it strives to do (in my opinion). There are hierarchies of descriptions of physical systems, physics is a framework for providing a mathematical description of nature with predictive power at various hierarchies, and connecting between the various hierarchies, etc. I truly fell in love when I learned the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics (I was on the fence with pure math or computer science at the time), and about the renormalization group. I ended up studying physics, specifically theoretical condensed matter, specifically 'strongly-correlated' systems which realize 'topological' quantum matter and quantum information based interpretations of quantum matter, and am very happy with my choices (so far). There's also a slight overlap of this side of theoretical condensed matter with high-energy people (topological quantum field theory, tensor networks in quantum gravity, etc.), and seeing the rigorous version of these fields has mostly removed (1) in my mind.",

        "Practically speaking: at least in Physics once you reach a certain level of education the rules around significant figures become less important. You're going to learn to calculate with errors like a value is 2.0 +/- 0.3. Then the number of sig figs to write becomes obvious: if your value is 2.0 +/- 0.3, there's no point in writing out 2.035 +/- 0.3, because the 0.035 is completely swallowed up by the error. In the meantime -- do whatever your teacher grading your work says to do.",
        "It's 40 years since I did physics at university, so do please take this with a pinch of salt, but I've always preferred to calculate the minimum and maximum values which the calculation could produce, and use them to determine how many significant figures are appropriate. In your example I'm assuming that 2.0, 3.55, 4.567 and 8.99 are all real-world measurements. A measurement quoted as 2.0 means the actual value is somewhere between 1.95 and 2.05; 3.55 means the actual value is somewhere between 3.545 and 3.555; and so on. So the minimum value this calculation can produce is (1.95+3.545)\\*(4.5665+8.985) = 74.46549.... and the maximum value is (2.05+3.555)\\*(4.5675+8.995) = 76.01781.... The value you get when you ignore the possible inaccuracies is (2.0+3.55)\\*(4.567+8.99) = 75.24135 so I think the consideration of the minimum and maximum indicates that you can only justify quoting the answer as 75."

For instance a satellite at 500km will take \\~25 years to come back to Earth, while a satellite at 1300km will take more than 1000 years. For a satellite at 800km, the semi-major axis decay can vary between 10m and 200m per month depending on the solar activity.",
        "To your last question: No, the SOI is something entirely different, it has nothing to do with atmospheric drag. SOI is basically a concept of orbital mechanics, defining a region around a celestial body in a multi-body system, in which said body's gravity is the dominating factor. Let me give you a brief example: How can we get from lets say a low earth orbit to an orbit around the moon? What we do (simplified) is a burn, so that our orbit around earth gets more and more elliptical, until the apoapsis intersects with the moon's SOI (or rather where it will be when we arrive there). So at first our s/c will continue on an highly eccentrical orbit around earth. When our s/c reaches a point at about 64,000km distance from the moon's center (its SOI), the moon's gravity will become the dominant force for the s/c in relation to earth' gravity and it will be caught in an orbit around the moon. This btw is called a trans-lunar injection."

However if a real human were to attempt this, we\u2019re talking running something like 6-10 hours, which is hard on the body and needs working up to.  Your body burns energy differently when it\u2019s under that kind of stress. And knowing if the weight you\u2019re losing is water, fat, or even muscle is tricky and related to diet, training, sleep, hydration and so forth. Then your body would probably be ravenously hungry and thirsty and you might just put it right back on. But marathoners, according to my brief internet search, lose 6-10 lbs, the bulk of which is water but probably some fat too. Again, no expert, just cursory knowledge through personal diet and exercise routines.",
        "IANAB but here is a low-chemistry, fairly approachable article about the metabolism of fat (and other energy sources): And it looks like you're correct: the majority of lost mass seems to be through exhalation (which I would not have thought). However, you can't factor out sweat loss completely, as about 20% of the metabolized fat _becomes_ water.",
        "Short answer is yes you will lose weight Longer answer is that how much weight you lose is complicated and depends on what type of macromolecule you are metabolizing, and how completely you are metabolizing it, and how accurately you are measuring calories burned. Unless you are strapped to a CO2 meter to measure how much carbon dioxide you are breathing out, you are just estimating caloric burn. Next if the only calories you are burning are from fat and they are metabolized completely to CO2, then that could be directly calculated from the CO2 you breath out, and the weights would match. However most exercise that is not long duration medium/low intensity will not trigger sustained fat burning metabolism. You simply cannot supply your body with sufficient oxygen to maintain fat burn with any other exercise form. Glucose liberated from glycogen stores is the most common fuel source your body will burn, and a lot of it gets metabolized to lactic acid. Your muscles can't do anything with lactic acid, and it is an acid so it will burn your muscles as it accumulates. Your Muscles dump it into your blood and thanks to the Cory Cycle your liver can soak up that lactic acid and recycle it back to glucose which it then sends out into the blood again for your muscles to take up. If we're keeping track of weight here, Glucose is \\~180Grams/Mole, and lactic acid is \\~90Grams/Mole. Each Glucose is broken down in to 2 Lactic acid molecules, so with the Cory cycle, this is pretty much a net zero for weight loss. Your heart muscle can metabolize lactic acid (it is an absolute beast that can metabolize just about any and every sugar, fat, and amino acid source), so interestingly following a hard workout which produces high levels of skeletal muscle lactic acid, there is often a long post workout metabolic state where your heart is burning all that accumulated lactic acid and since this metabolism does consume the lactic acid, you do generate CO2 from it, and you will have a weight loss that is delayed."

Ultimately pressure is the quantity being calculated from the other physical variables, so perhaps it would be better to think of it as a pressure function: P(n, T, V) = nRT/V. As you seem to understand, there's no way for you to change the pressure as a variable and see it lead to an increase in temperature; if those two are the only quantities changing, in the physical system it will always be because you're increasing the temperature, and that this is leading to an increase in pressure. Likewise, you can increase the volume and see the pressure decrease, or increase the amount of gas and see the pressure increase, or simultaneously vary the three variables in specific to keep the pressure the same (e.g. decreasing volume while simultaneously decreasing temperature, and so on). Further complicating the matter is of course how specific processes used to tweak these variables often change more than one variable simultaneously, like how adiabatic compression decreases volume and increases temperature at the same time, with both contributing to an increase in pressure.",
        "Your memory is mixing two things. The ideal gas law on the one and, and thermodynamic processes and the first law of thermodynamics on the other. You are correct that in the ideal gas law, the equation is balanced. But in order to decrease the volume you have to do work on the gas (you're pushing against the pressure). If the compression of a gas is an [adiabatic process], as is typical of a gas enclosed in a container in the real world (e.g. a bicycle pump), then that work goes into increasing the internal energy (i.e., temperature) of the gas.",
        "this stuff is a lot easier to intuitively understand if you buy into the 'particles in a box' model for understanding gasses.  Imagine the gas as a bunch of discrete point particles bouncing around inside the container. Temperature is related to the speed of each particle, and pressure is the speed of each particle multiplied with how often it collides with the side of he container. This model isn't 100% accurate, but it does really help to think about when considering PV=nRT relations."

Electrons are leptons and are not made of quarks, I'll get to that in a minute though. There are other baryons besides protons and neutrons and many mesons but we don't usually think of them because they are generally not very stable. These also have integer charges of +1, 0, or -1 like with pions. Anti protons likewise also have a -1 charge and are composed of the antiquark versions of the stuff that makes up regular protons, each with the opposite fractional charge As for why electrons and other leptons (Tau and Muons) have an integer charge, or why quarks have the particular fractional charges they have, I'm not really sure.

These predators and more importantly their prey had to evolve complex sensory organs as well as a kind of \"mental stage\" that would allow them to be aware of the others existence, even when no one else was in sight. What evolved along with the mental image was a way of experiencing affective feelings. Affective means emotional consciousness, which in its simplest form is feelings of good or bad. These feelings are a way of assigning importance to sensations and experiences. The prey worms were the ancestors to the most successful escape artists in the seas, those of course being Chordates, which eventually went on to produce all current vertebrates. The predators on the other hand became invertebrates like our modern arthropods. TL;DR: most non-sessile animals are self-aware/conscious and have been since ~0.5 BYA"

I'm sure there are wolf populations that are less impacted (these studies were all on specific locations)...but the only wolf populations that aren't near lots of people are also in harsh northern climates, which is likely to cause high mortality. There's definitely significant human impacts on pinnipeds from boat strikes, net entanglements, etc, but from my reading they don't seem to play as high a role in mortality. Aside from human impacts and predation, you've also got things like food availability, disease, intraspecific combat, injuries, and intrinsic rate of aging that can play an important role in lifespan. It'd be easy to see how those other factors could combine to outweigh predation as a limiter on long lifespans. Another potential factor is that you are comparing a large group of species to a couple of species. You'd expect that, in a large group of species, some would tend to live longer than others. So your odds of getting a longer lived species go up as you compare all pinnipeds to just a couple of land carnivorans. It'd be interesting to see the comparison of all terrestrial and all marine carnivorans. Actually I just found one, which has marine carnivores living shorter than terrestrial ones when accounting for size. However it's important to note that this just uses maximum recorded lifespans (mostly in captivity) as opposed to wild average lifespans, which are more impacted by the enviromental factors I discussed above. So what you may also be seeing is the effect of comparing the longest lived of a bunch of big marine carnivorans to a few small terrestrial ones."

You\u2019re changing the medium on which the line exists. The fact that the line is no longer straight is just an incidental side effect of the fact that the paper is folded. Gravity doesn\u2019t directly alter light and bend or change it. Gravity distorts the reality light exists in.",
        "Lots of people are giving some really interesting answers to this question. Lots of people are kind of re-iterating THAT gravity bends light and HOW, but they\u2019re not really giving a lot of good answers WHY. There\u2019s a lot of approaches to tackle this, but I think you could succinctly summarize it this way: gravity influences things that can carry energy. Gravity is often shown as an object with mass warping spacetime, which is true- but, Einstein taught us that there is a mass-energy equivalence. Photons don\u2019t have mass, but they do have energy.",
        "Understanding this requires knowing that in General Relativity, gravity is not a force. Instead, gravity is the warping of space and time, so that the normal rules of geometry don't work in the same familiar way. There are some basic notions that can help you intuit this better, but real understanding pretty much requires getting into some math. Here's the two most important ideas. 1. Objects always travel in a \"straight line\" if undisturbed... a straight line in spacetime, that is. 2. Spacetime can be curved, so a \"straight line\" may not have the same meaning anymore. The equivalent of a straight line in a space which has curvature is called a geodesic. All objects \\*attempt\\* to travel along a geodesic in spacetime, unless something causes them to accelerate off of that geodesic. When you're sitting in your chair, the geodesic for your body is a line that would like you to go straight down. If the chair and floor were to vanish, you'd immediately start to follow that path... but you're constantly being interrupted by those objects. Light also follows a geodesic; the straightest line in curved space that it can. Because spacetime has curvature, the light will seem to \"bend\" its path, but the reality is essentially the opposite. Light keeps going \"straight\" but the universe itself bends. Draw a straight line on a piece of paper, then bend the paper. This is how the light is \"bent\" by gravity.",
        "You\u2019re used to the idea that a mass will follow a straight line in space, unless acted on by an outside force. But it\u2019s not quite true. A mass will instead follow a straight line in *spacetime*. It turns out that the tendency of an object to follow a straight line in spacetime is identical to gravity.",
        "Light is a geodesic and always travels in a strait line. It\u2019s the space itself that is warped, and the light path bends with it. Mass isn\u2019t necessary. For example, the escape velocity from earth of a bullet and a bowing ball are the same. It depends only upon the mass of the earth (and the distance from its center of mass)."

So it is consistent with a property of space itself, therefore it's called \"vacuum energy density\".

Additional assumptions are necessary (for example, \"all interactions between an object and the electromagnetic field are parametrized by a single quantity, namely, the electric charge\" and \"the electromagnetic field is a four-vector field (rather than a scalar field or tensor field)\"). Second, the list of assumptions you've shown here includes things that are ***not necessary*** for many physical theories. For example, non-relativistic mechanics has no need for Lorentz invariance as an assumption, instead using Galilean invariance. In other contexts, it might be actively detrimental to assume this kind of symmetry: for example, if you're describing the field theory of vibrations in a crystal, where the lattice planes and spacing make the space you're working with anisotropic, you might find that relying on assumptions that presuppose isotropy gives you the wrong answer. Anyway, \"simple\" here just refers to the principle of parsimony; we start with assuming that the Lagrangian depends on as few parameters as possible, and expand the list if we find that it's insufficient, rather than starting with a Lagrangian with too many parameters."

Medical conditions can change the amount of calories the body needs by default (Base Metabolic Rate, or BMR). This, coupled with habit and environmental differences, makes figuring out an individuals total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) more difficult. Nutrition information on packaged goods is also not perfect; at least in the US, there is a relatively large range seen as acceptable (up to 20\u00f7 variance depending on nutrient). You could assume you are in a 500 kcal daily deficit -- but actually be consuming 200 kcals over what you track, and over-estimating your TDEE by 300 kcals, and bam -- no deficit at all. This means any \"cheat\" days actually contribute to a surplus, causing weight gain. TL;DR - Weight loss is guaranteed if you are in a caloric deficit. Lack of weight loss means you are not in a deficit; this can be because of poor tracking of intake, or incorrect estimation of caloric expenditure -- both of which are difficult to get exact, for varying reasons.",
        "The most likely reason is they mis-measured how many calories they consumed. If you burn 2000 calories a day and then cut your consumption from 2500 to 2100 a day you'll still gain weight. If you cut consumption to 1975 calories per day you'll lose weight but it will take months for it to be noticeable. A second factor is that calories in and out are very fuzzy. All 500 calorie meals are not created equal; there are innumerable factors affecting how much of the energy is absorbed. Same with calories burned.

Basically, the diffraction pattern of a infinitesimally small source of light, which if I recall correctly, for an ideal lens is an Airy pattern, but it's possible I'm misremembering that part. So for image resolution, the more important metric is the distance where you can tell two objects apart from each other, where closer than that distance you can't resolve two different objects, it just looks like 1 blurred object. For why you can see differences between 50, 100 and 200 nm nanoparticles in your light microscope, are you sure you're not just observing differences in brightness? A brighter object might appear to be a different size, especially if the boundary between the signal and the background noise is a bit fuzzy, depending on the number of photons emitted by the object. Because otherwise, I don't think I would expect a difference to be observable between say a 50 nm and 100 nm particle, all other things being equal.

Take it outside, decompress it and it cools down, then let it warm up to \"ambient\" outside. Compress it again and bring it in. So the only power input is a compressor for the gas, which isn't that much. Then the gas expands outside and cools, gets \"warmed\" outside for free (even if it's not warm outside) and compressed again so it warms up, and brings the heat inside. But yeah, I guess you could say that strictly speaking, in terms of only the device, then of course it's not 300% efficient. But compared to the amount of energy needed to achieve the same amount of heating, it is. It's also less efficient over a large temperature difference, I imagine, but they only tell you the most favorable number. But I get that you're confused about this.

        "Boilers and furnaces generate heat, and you can never get more than 100% efficient creating heat. The best you can do is minimize energy loss. Heat pumps cheat: they grab already-created heat from the ambient air, and move it into your home. All they need to spend energy on is a compressor. Relative to the temperature change in your house, the energy cost if running that compressor can be 3-4 times less than a boiler or furnace. So they say \u201c300-400% efficient.\u201d",

So instead of burning gas to run a heat engine and have that run a heat pump at low efficiency to make a turbine go, we run that heat engine to make electricity and then run a lot of heat pumps all over the place at great efficiency. This is just more bang for your buck. The 300% are true and actually the lower bound under normal circumstances.",

So, to your perpetual motion concerns, you need to think of a [heat engine] with hot/cold resvivors. For any given hot/cold system, there's a limited amount of energy you can extract. Just as you can't efficiently generate useful power from warm air (or even household steam), it takes a lot less energy to move a calorie from 275K air to 300K air than it does to move it from 275k air to 800K steam. The efficiency of a heat pump is at most the reciprocal of the efficiency of an engine that uses the same temperature difference. Rest assured, the amount a heat pump increases the extractable energy of the system is less than the energy it consumes. Similarly, the total energy of the system (electric + hot reservoir + cold reservoir) does not increase.",
        "Different forms of energy have different capacities to do work; this is known as exergy, and is related to entropy. Thermal energy is highly unordered, and thus has very low exergy; in fact, thermal energy in equilibrium can't be used to do work at all. And even if you do have a temperature difference, you are limited to the [Carnot efficiency] of that difference. What a heat pump does is essentially the reverse of this. In other words, if you have a Carnot efficiency of 0.25 (25%) for a given temperature difference, then the maximum efficiency a heat pump can have for that difference is given by 1/0.25, i.e. 4 in this case. This would represent a 400% efficiency in moving thermal energy, and the reason that works is that you could only ever get 25% back again as work at the theoretical maximum, leaving you right back where you started (of course, in real life heat pumps and heat engines are never operating at exactly the theoretical maximum either, and heat pumps tend to fall well below). You can easily calculate the Carnot efficiency for a temperature difference by subtracting the ratio of the cold to the hot temperature (in kelvins) from 1. For example, for the temperature difference between 0\u00b0 C and 25\u00b0 C, you get `1 - 273.15 / 298.15 = ~0.084`; in other words, an efficiency of ~8.4%, meaning you could theoretically have a heat pump with an efficiency of `1/0.084 = ~11.9` there (1190% efficiency). Of course, you have to use an energy source with a higher amount of exergy to do the work. As it turns out, electrical energy is essentially perfectly ordered energy, where 100% of the energy is available to do work with. Since we don't need perfectly ordered energy to maintain a thermal equilibrium (and not freeze to death), we can use a fraction of that neatly ordered electrical energy to move unordered thermal energy."

Additionally, for an element to participate in one of these reactions it often has to be able to exist in a liquid or gas phase such as water or carbon dioxide. Scientists just use the massive reservoirs of these elements in the form of the ocean and atmosphere as the reference point since these will be homogeneous."

You can't move the boat without creating waves in the water, and likewise any waves in the water will change the position of the boat. By connecting two big rods to the ends of a battery, electrons will flow into the rod connected to the negative end and out of the rod connected to the positive end. This will generate EM waves that can be detected with a similar apparatus. If you can encode information into the way you connect and disconnect the battery to the rods, you can transmit information long distances by just moving electrons back and forth in a rod.

In general however, arthropods molt based on growth, and shed whenever they are too big because their exoskeleton cant grow with them. Limitations with molting being harder and harder with large sizes sets lifespan limits for some large arthropods like lobsters and large tarantulas. Metamorphisms can be considered a special type of molt. In some species there can be significant overlap when they go through several incremental changes like dragonflies."

        "As with a lot of things in biology, the answer to this question is as much about the journey as the destination. The ancestral vertebrates appears to have had a single median nostril leading to an olfactory chamber. This was used for sensing smells. In jawed vertebrates, two nostrils are present. These were (and still are, in most fish) in the form of small, u-shaped channels. Water flows in the front of the nostril, through it, and out the back. These nostrils were for sensing smell, and the u-shape allowed more efficient water flow through the nostril. Why have one on each side of the head? Because then a fish can tell from which direction a scent is coming. Which side of the head is picking up more scent? That's the side nearer to whatever is making the smell. That's a very useful bit of information. At some point in the ancestors of tetrapods, the vertebrates which live on land, the back part of this u-shaped nostril tube migrated down, across the lip, and into the roof of the mouth. This is a pretty crazy movement, and it's not clear why it happened, but there's decent fossil evidence for it. It's obviously quite useful once it's happened, though, because it lets the fish breathe air through nostrils. We are talking fish with lungs at this point. It's quite useful to be a fish with lungs, if you live in hot, swampy water, and there are plenty of air breathing fish today. And it's quite useful to be able to just stick the tip of your snoot above water to get a breath of fresh air. It is, however, not always particularly useful to have nostrils just opening right into the roof of your mouth (although it seems to work ok for frogs). In most tetrapods, there's a shelf of bone and tissue (the palate) separating the roof of the mouth from the internal nostrils. Above the palate are the sinuses, where the air from the nostrils passes through the head before joining the throat at the back of the palate. And with that, we've arrived at more or less what humans have. Two nostrils, because it was convenient for fish to be able to tell which direction smells were coming from. Joining together, because they both migrated inside the mouth, and then got enclosed by the palate to form the sinuses, and then travel back to a common exit point in the throat, on the way to the lungs.",

In other words, in the temperature and pressure regimes in which we typically work with gases, the gas molecules are far enough apart on average that intermolecular forces are on average quite weak, and even when they two gas molecules get close together by chance, their kinetic energy is much higher than the potential energy of the intermolecular interactions.",

If you move all the molecules in the same direction, it's not a disorderly agitation, it's just a basic flow of gas which is measured with velocity and kinetic energy, not with temperature and thermal energy. Also, it is important to notice that what you measures by putting a thermometer in a moving flow of gas is not the absolute temperature, it's the stagnation temperature, which depends on the velocity of the flow. It's basically a measurement of thermal energy after that the measured flow made an isentropic conversion of kinetic energy into thermal energy. The absolute temperature is called the thermodynamic temperature and does not depends on the velocity of the fluid. It is the stagnation temperature corrected by removing the \"kinetic energy\" part of it.",

If you use a mercury thermometer in non-equilibrium setting, you're not measuring temperature (mostly because temperature in this case just doesn't exist). Second is that you think that temperature is fundamentally related to statistical moments of kinetic energy. That's basically just a coincidence that holds true for systems of compact classical bodies (like classical gasses) which have those. That's not guaranteed, e.g. we can still talk about heat baths of classical fields, or temperatures of quantum systems that are not in kinetic energy eigenstates. Temperature is either (both) of: a) A parameter that describes relation between change of entropy and change of internal energy of *any* system. b) A property that's equal between *any* two systems in thermal equilibrium.

This process can be done in one batch as far as i know. If however you are interested in using microbes, the ones that come to mind might be the usage of microbes inside ruminants' gut but since they could be difficult to cultivate especially in the long term and could be quite expensive, you need to familiarize yourself with controlling the environment and media they are being cultivated at, as well as the concept of innoculation scale up (so you can start with lets say 100 gram of microbe and allow it to progressively propagate in an also progressively larger container/media), this would save cost and allow you to potentially have an almost indefinite amount of this cellulolytic microbe (it depends on how well you keep it alive and managing their nutrient and waste too!). After the cellulolytic process is done, you are left with a glucose water that you can just add beer yeast or bread yeast, keep it closed with an airlock until it stops bubbling and distill it. When making biofuel which involves fermentation, to best of my knowledge, its impossible to have a system such that the product (ethanol) would separate out from the media/fermentation tank since ethanol is miscible in water (since microbe culture is mostly water). And yea, distilling the fermentation stock after its done WILL surely kill everything whether its enzyme you are using or the microbe used to break it down, unless if you can somehow separate (like centrifuge the hell out of it) the biomass from the product and recycle it And lastly, if i were you, i would have a bag of well kept, working cellulase enzyme in case i want to use it to break down cellulose.

Even chemical bonds have a mass contribution, though chemical binding energy is so much lower that this mass change is very tiny."

They seek what they still miss. To do so (while managing storage able to preserve it) is a complex task, and, collectively, the anthill is very intelligent about it. A final consideration is that refined sugar requires water for you to access its wealth of concentrated calories. Taken alone, it will just burn you dry alive.

From a Thermodynamic analysis, a system of very low temperature / total energy will have its components dispersed across a small number of energy levels. When this occurs you get degenerate matter, for example fermionic or bosonic condensates, which are distinctly quantum phenomena. At higher temperatures the components will be distributed across a very wide array of energy levels, encompassing a much larger range of energies than the gap between energy levels, and classical thermodynamics is recovered. Essentially, you often observe quantum behaviour when you have low energies, or few components in your system. In this case the gap between energy levels is significant compared to the distribution across the energy levels, and is therefore noticeable."

This is even more true of smaller cave invertebrates, which can pass through even narrower cracks. It's also worth noting that some of these channels and passages may only occasionally open up, or may come and go as time goes by.

        "Great question, really gets at the heart of cell biology and pathology! There\u2019s a way to categorize cell death into two groups: apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis is programmed cell death where the cell itself chooses to die (think old cells, cells that recognize they\u2019re infected, etc) whereas as necrosis is cell death due to trauma (physical, chemical, etc). With apoptosis, the cell uses it\u2019s own recycling mechanisms to break down its components and digests itself. With necrosis, the cell release active components to the environment. The implications of this is actually used to test for diseases in the human body. Best example of this is troponin/creative kinase for myocardial infarction (heart attack). If the heart undergoes trauma-in this case, low blood flow-the muscle cells rapidly deteriorate and released into the blood. While your body can rapidly metabolize these components through proteins already in your serum alongside active metabolization and excretion via liver/kidney, sometimes the immune system can trigger inflammation while cleaning up these particles. There\u2019s also a well studied mechanism called ischemia reperfusion injury where mitochondrial proteins from damaged heart cells trigger further damage after getting blood supply back to the heart post-MI (through breaking clots in the heart or deploying a balloon in the heart vessels to open up cardiac arteries). Over time your body does return to baseline through a variety of these biochemical processes but it can vary depending on the released cellular component. If you\u2019re interested in reading more, I\u2019d highly recommend looking into how the body handles foreign RNA/DNA/bacterial components. Generally, it\u2019s the same with your own cell components but can lead to autoimmune disease if your white blood cell mounts a sustained attack.

        "Classical physics was thought to be nearly complete at the time. Newtonian physics, thermal physics, and electromagnetism were the huge advances of the 19th Century. J.J. Thomson discovered cathode rays (electrons) right at the end of the 19th Century. Electrons were not understood to be \"wavicles\" until later, they were considered to be particles. X rays had just been discovered and it was not fully obvious yet that they were electromagnetic waves, though that was the leading theory. Gamma rays had been observed but were not named (by Rutherford) for another three years. Rutherford had his surprising result with alpha rays ten years later -- in 1900, JJ Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model of the atom was considered the most likely structure of matter, and it was being actively researched. There were problems with certain aspects of classical theory, two of which were famously called out in 1900 as \"storm clouds on the horizon\" by Lord Kelvin (after whom the temperature scale is named). The first of Kelvin's clouds was the motion of the \u00e6ther relative to mass (electromagnetic waves were still posited to be excitations of a tenuous medium called \"\u00e6ther\" or \"ether\", which was thought to have a preferred reference frame that Michelson and Morley had utterly failed to identify in 1887; \u00e6theric dragging by massive bodies was considered the most likely reason -- but there were already problems with that by 1900). The second of Kelvin's clouds was the Boltzmann equipartition theorem in thermodynamics, which led directly to the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" of the Rayleigh-Jeans black body radiation law. There were some other problems with classical theory at that time. In particular, self-interaction of electric charges led to both the only use of the third time derivative of position (jerk, sense 2) in all fundamental physics, and also to time-reversed causality in which electric charges had to respond to an applied force before the force switched on; and the Hertz-Heaviside Equations (which we now call Maxwell's Equations after everyone decided Oliver Heaviside was a big ol' jerk, sense 1) had already been shown both to be correct and also to not be invariant under Galilean transformations (hence the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction, which was noticed first by FitzGerald in 1889 and, er, expanded by Lorentz in 1892). That second problem was comparable to the current state of affairs today, in which quantum mechanics works really well and general relativity works really well but the two don't mesh; only in that time it was Newtonian mechanics and the theory of E&M that were on a collision course.",
        "I'm not really an expert in history, so take this with a grain of salt. In particular, I have no idea about the every day life of physicists. In my opinion, there is a contrast between research of the late 19th century and earlier stuff: If you speak the respective language, you can read papers of the late 19th century about e.g. thermodynamics by Clausius kind of similarly to today: E.g. they use equations to describe stuff, which wasn't the case in the time of Newton. Two big branches of 19th century physics I can think of are thermodynamics and electrodynamics. Thermodynamics was probably motivated by applications in the industry (steam engines), but also helped improving them. From a modern point of view a huge part of thermodynamics was formulated similarly in the 19th century: \"Big\" guys in thermodynamics like Clausius, Gibbs and Boltzmann did their major contributions in the second part of the 19th century: The 3 laws of TD were formulated by Clausius (and others probably), Boltzmann lay the groundwork of statistical physics with his kinetic gas theory.Of course, more rigorous formulations were done later on in the 20th century. Electrodynamics also mainly evolved in the 19th century, beginning with Gauss's and Ampere's law, then evolving with Faraday's induction and finally resulting in the Maxwell (Herz) equations. They also recognized in the late 19th century that the Maxwell equations are not Galilei invariant and Lorentz (or Lorenz??) postulated his transformation. The Michelson Morley experiment was also conducted in the late 19th century, disproving the aether theory. As a result, there was a clue that there's more to the world than the Galilei transformation. Marie Curie also did work on radiology in the late 19th century. In the very late 19th century the Rayleigh-Jeans-law (including the ultraviolet catastrophe) was derived, and in the early 19hundreds Planck solved the issue with his law, which was later on one of the first motiviations for quantum mechanics. It was well known that something is wrong with Newtons gravity, as e.g. the perihelion precession of mercury was predicted wrongly by it. Furthermore, some advances in classical mechanics were made, e.g. the poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem. Around 1800 lagrangian mechanics were developed and in the early 19th century hamiltonian mechanics. (Bear in mind that there were still some major achievements in classical mechanics in the second half of the 20th century like the KAM theorem or chaos theory). In summary, in my opinion a lot of stuff was going on in the second half of the 19th century, laying the groud work for relativity and QM. Multiple experimental and conceptual issues (mercury, Maxwells equations transform differently than newtons) were solved by relativity, and some first ideas that evolved into QM later on (ultraviolet catastrophe, maybe radiology) were discovered. Furthermore, a big part of thermodynamics was derived."

        "These are very and a lot of different things. Physically \"color\" is just a more fancy name of a specific wavelength of light. Light of different wave length doesn't simply add, that's just not how light behaves. Color as in color perception has very few to do with color in the physical sense. Our eyes have bio receptors detecting light of different wavelength and different intensity. Then our brain interprets this as a color. Now the \"artistic\" mixing of colors is another thing aswell and depends on using pigments, chromophores, (...).",
        "One important detail to remember is that color is purely a psychological effect. That is, the color red only exists in your head. It is an interpretation of signals sent by your eye. This might sound obvious, but it is important. One important consequence is that there aren't seven colors, even though we often see things that way. There are millions that we can distinguish. Humans draw arbitrary borders and say \"All colors that look like this are shades of red.\" But that distinction is arbitrary and culturally dependent. White light doesn't have to consist of seven colors. It can just be one color. Any sufficiently bright light will look white. At the same time, it could contain a lot of wavelengths. Spectroscopy is a technic often used to look at the chemical composition of something by breaking the light in it up into wavelengths (I put the wiki link below if you want to look at it). This requires specialized equipment because we can't use our eyes. Because that is not how our eyes work. Our eyes and our brains mix and combine colors together. In your eye, you (unless you are color blind) have three cones, called the L, M, and S cone. These cones each respond to a different range of light wavelengths. If you look at the wiki link, you can see the range of wavelengths for each cone and how they are distributed. Let's say some incoming light of 590 nm hits your eye. This is a bit off of the peak of the M-cone so it will end a medium signal to your brain. It is near the peak for the L-Cone so that will send a strong signal to your brain. Your brain will look at these two signals and create an image out of them. You will see a color that most people would call orange. But, of course, in reality, your eye isn't being hit by a single wavelength of light. Rather, you are getting all sorts of wavelengths of light. This is where color mixing comes in. Let's say we have several different wavelengths of light all coming from the same place. They are, say 620 nm and 540 nm. If we adjust how much light is coming from those two sources so that the M-cone and the L-cone are stimulated in the exact same way as they would have been with the single 590 nm source, then your brain will get the exact same signal that it got from the incoming 590 nm of light and it will interpret the object as being orange. Even though, most people would call 620 nm of light red and 540 green (or greenish). In other words, by mixing the red light and the green light, your eyes saw orange. This is why any sufficiently bright light will appear white. Because, basically, enough of any color floods out all of the receptors in your eye, causing them all to max out and your brain takes that as white. In reality, everything is more complicated. Nothing outputs exactly one wavelength of light. Your eye is being bombarded with signals all of the time. But that is the basics. Color mixing works because there are different ways to stimulate the cones in your eyes the exact same amount. The colors you get are not just average wavelengths, as I think was implied by my explanation. Adjusting the intensities of the 620 nm light and the 540 nm light will cause you to see different colors. This is why screens can get away with having only three colors in them. They adjust how much of each color light they are outputting. There are ways to calculate the equivalent wavelengths. And there is a wiki for that one too, so I will put it at the bottom. Side note, this is why people say purple is not a real color. If you look at the graph in the cone wiki, you will notice that red and blue are on the far ends of each other. There is no single wavelength that responses to purple. Rather, purple is what you see when the L-cone and the S-cone are stimulated at the same time."

The point of the test is to see if the container is less absorbant than water, which roughly represents most food items; this shows that the oven will cook your food, and not cook the container."

Instead needed to claim an emphasis and take several courses in that area. So someone prepping for med school might take anatomy and a few other pre-med courses. It worked out great for me.  I knew I would work in business my whole life for the money but did not want to study it my whole college career. I took Physics with Emphasis in Entrepreneurship.

If you're asking if for example all X-chromosomes are the same, the answer is still no. But they'd contain the same set of genes, just with massive variations in between them. Is some information deactivated: Yes, that's called epigenetics. But that doesn't really have anything to do with what you're asking about in the first place. Is there one DNA molecule that contains all information? For humans, no. Each chromosome is a part of the genome. It was just more efficient (and safer) to have many smaller pieces than one giant one. (There are of course plenty of primitive organisms that have just one single genomic DNA molecule: Literally all bacteria and other procaryots. But those are technically not considered chromosomes.) So, humans have 46 chromosomes in total, 23 sets of 2. (Or if you wanna be really technical 22 sets of 2, and 2 gonosomes) All of them are generally required to form a fully functional organism.

        "You\u2019re only looking at half the picture, look at the nucleophile. In basic solution, the nucleophile is OH^- and there is a lot of it. It is a very strong nucleophile and is capable of attacking an ester. When that attacks the carbonyl and the tetrahedral intermediate is formed, there are two possible leaving groups when the carbonyl reforms. Either OH^- which then just reforms the ester, or OR^- which would form the carboxylic acid. Neither are relatively good leaving groups when compared to a halide or something like that, but they are the only options and something has to go. Both of these will occur, however when the OR^- leaves to form the carboxylic acid, the reaction is irreversible because it almost instantly gets deprotonated to form a non-electrophilic carboxylate which drives the reaction forward. Under acidic conditions, there is extremely little hydroxide. The only available nucleophile is water. Water is a much weaker nucleophile, so it requires a very strong electrophile in order to react. The ester is not a very strong electrophile, but a protonated ester is. So water will attack the protonated ester forming the tetrahedral intermediate. From there the three possible leaving groups are hydroxide, alkoxide, or water. Water is by far the best leaving group so that will happen most of the time reforming the ester. However, sometimes when the tetrahedral intermediate forms a proton from the water nucleophile will transfer to the alkoxy group. Now the leaving group options are either of the two hydroxides or an alcohol. The alcohol is by far the best leaving group so it will leave. This reaction does not have a thermodynamically irreversible step to push the reaction forward, so you just need a huge excess of water to favor hydrolysis rather than re-esterification."

Why limit our survivability to a very narrow range of temperatures and pressures, such that we will likely never explore the universe?",
        "This isn't really parsed like a scientific question. Obviously, electromagnetic induction is supremely useful. The fact that we're on the internet is a testament to that fact. In a universe absent of this, it would also be a universe absent of the electromagnetic force since induction is a consequence of that force. This isn't even beginning to address the question of material properties which would pretty much be absent. No electron orbitals, no chemical bonds, no macroscopic matter, no anything really. Electromagnetism is simply a fundamental fact of the universe and is a feature of the physics governing particles. Charged particles exert forces on one another, their movements produce magnetic fields which in turn induce electric currents. This is as much a seemingly brute fact of nature as the other fundamental forces(strong and weak nuclear force and gravity). What this emerges from, if there is something deeper than that, is an ongoing matter of theoretical inquiry. I don't think anyone can presently tell you, with any confidence, what fundamental substrate(if any) these things supervene on. Making human life easier is a tricky way to phrase it. I'm not personally convinced these facts of the universe exist for us, or to make our lives easier. Rather, I think we simply live in a universe where there exists phenomena like electromagnetism to utilize. Unless you mean, that the idea of electromagnetism is a useful fiction for us to understand said phenomena, then I'd say that's a philosophical take and not in my wheel house. Coming back to my initial point, \"why\" isn't really a question for science. I cannot tell you why electromagnetism exists anymore than I can tell you the meaning of life.

Once in a while, their highly experienced handlers make a mistake, and the bear gets frustrated. A frustrated bear lashes out, and with their strength, it is very easy to seriously or mortally injure a person. The very high consequence of those interactions is why domestication is not worth it. Think about how stupid a lot of people are with dogs, and imagine what the consequence would be if instead of a warning growl, you got mauled. I once had to temporarily house two cubs before a wildlife rehab faculty had room for them. It was hot, so I had to hose them down several times a day. They loved it, and if I wasn't fast enough with the hose, they got frustrated and charged at me from inside the trap. As for social structure, bears don't live in packs, but they do interact with each other socially. Their territories overlap those of other bears, and female offspring often stay in their natal home range, even after they've become independent. Play is also not just for animals to learn to interact with members of their own species; it also helps them develop the coordination and muscle strength that they will need for hunting and for defending themselves."

These will form another bond and you get [perbromate] with the bromine and three double-bound oxygens having a formal charge of 0 and the one single-bound oxygen having a formal charge of -1 (ignoring resonance) for an overall charge of -1. Asking why Se-83 selenate doesn't decompose upon decay to Br-83 perbromate is the same as asking why perbromate doesn't decompose. Because it is chemically stable. One thing I glossed over is that there is also an electron with an energy of 0.1506 MeV flying out of that nucleus. This energy is more than enough to break every bond in the molecule if it were to be absorbed by the bonding electrons. The reason it doesn't is because the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with that energy is around 3 picometers. The de Broglie wavelength is a function of the momentum of a particle and describes the length scale at which quantum mechanical phenomena may occur due to the wave-like nature of the particle. The Br-O bond length in perbromate is 160 picometers. Because these lengths are so different, that high energy electron is extremely unlikely to interact with the bonding electrons in perbromate and flies right through. There are other examples of chemically stable molecules containing radioisotopes undergoing radioactive decay to form chemically unstable molecules, though. The bromine-83 formed from the beta decay of selenium-83 is itself radioactive with a half-life of 2.4 hours. It also undergoes beta decay to the stable krypton-83. In the case of Br-83 perbromate, this would form krypton tetroxide which is not stable and would instantly decompose into krypton and oxygen gas.",
        "The recoil from the emitted beta ray would yeet the nucleus right out of its original molecule. What evidence do you have that it's somehow undisturbed? The flying bromine atom would bounce to a halt, disturbing other molecules on the way, and it might then pick up oxygen atoms as it came to a stop. But they wouldn't be the original atoms. Epistemic status: I estimated the recoil velocity as about 50 km/sec, but that was in my head. Am I wrong?"

        "The \"Big Bang\" is actually just the name of the theory that describes the development of the universe, rather than the name of a specific event at the start of the universe. The theory not only describes the early universe, but also the current universe, so in that sense the \"Big Bang\" continues today, albeit we aren't in the same phase of the theory as the early universe was. It would be simplest to link to the Wikipedia entry on this timeline: The phase that most aligns with what people imagine when they hear the words \"Big Bang\" is the inflationary period, which ended after around 10^-32 seconds (an extremely small fraction of a second). During the inflationary period, the universe expanded in volume by 10^78 times. I don't even know the word for that big of a number, but it's a literally astronomical amount of expansion in an incomprehensibly small period of time. However, we could also consider dividing what we imagine as the Big Bang from our current universe at around 380,000 years after the inflationary period. At this point, the universe had expanded and cooled enough that atomic matter began to form, which meant this was the first time that it became possible for material structures to begin forming and for light to escape into the universe (that initial release of light is what we now see as the Cosmic Microwave Background). The universe still expands today, and in fact that expansion is currently accelerating, so it's also not unreasonable to say that we're still living in the Big Bang now.",
        "Aside from the other answers, let's assume you mean the initial 'burst' pre-expansion period of a singularity becoming 'space'. From our perspective it was probably a few ten thousands of a second (I've read some claims it was 'up to 3 seconds'), but it doesn't really make much sense to measure it like that because all our concepts break down at that point. Everything was 'moving' and changing at such a pace that time wasn't really a stable thing, and the perspective of a hypothetical someone observing at that point it could have lasted forever or been unimaginably brief. You can kinda pick a theory for whichever option you prefer, especially if you're interested in an infinite density vs negative energy mindset. It's really hard to assign timescales to pretty much anything before a few hundred thousand years, especially in the face of so many unknowns being thrown up by JWST etc."

It's in understanding the hidden assumptions and letting go of the incorrect ones that the weirdness can be overcome. I'm going to guess that the weirdness comes from possibly thinking that if a flashlight were traveling at 0.5 c toward you, then the light arriving at you should arrive at 1.5 c. And you arrive at that expectation by thinking that velocities combine by simple addition. A lot of that comes from extrapolating from common experience. If you throw a rock at 35 mph out of a car that is going 55 mph, then you expect the rock to be going 90 mph with respect to the road. The problem is that while that's \\*approximately\\* right, it's not completely right, and the approximation proves itself to be wrong (proof being direct measurement) more and more as the speeds get higher. It's the assumption that velocity combine by addition \\*exactly\\* that's the incorrect one. This doesn't answer WHY the speed of light is constant -- that turns out to just a confirmed fact without a lot of justification -- but it does help you bridge the gap between what you expect to be true from common experience and what is really true, without throwing yourself into the disoriented free-fall of \"everything I believed to be true is wrong!\""

      "output": [
        "Generally there is a probability of transmission between two people, and probabilities are hardly 1 (meaning 100%). Usually you have some immunity to fresh COVID infections just when you have recovered from it. Think about it, when your body drives out the virus it knows which antibodies work against it. Specifically, there is something called mucosal immunity, its the immunity of the soft tissue in your nose and mouth. A good mucosal immunity leads to virus being fended off early on before being able to infect your body. This may drive down the transmission probability enough for you to not become infected. Additionally, it can be that there are days when a couple does not kiss, or doesn't interact heavily, etc. Furthermore, your bf may not be extremely infectious throughout the time when they test positive, but that period can be smaller (I am not saying you can rely on this, its hard to tell when you are most infectious and when you stop being infectious). So there are \"just a few days\" when the infection could be transmitted. Anyway, the immunity I talked about slowly wears off by roughly two means 1. your body is lowering its defences / forgetting 2. the virus mutates. It can be perfectly possible that while you were infected, your bf was still immune, half a year later, he got infected but you were still immune, etc. Initial immunity may also stem from vaccinations, etc. And then of course, there is also the chance that you or your body had a light symptom-free infection. For example, the last time my family got covid, my child must have brought it from school (fairly certain, barely any symptoms) but always tested negative and both parents had a cold and tested covid-positive."

Gravitational potential, by analogy, would be the kinetic energy gained by a unit mass as it fell some distance through a gravitational field.",
        "I assume you have heard the classic explaination, so here's a analogy I like that works well enough (people who actually know what they are talking about, feel free to correct) The traditional definition is how much potential energy is stored at a certain point per a unit of charge. The best way to get to what this means (imo) is to think of the mechanical analog. If you have a rollercoaster, at the top you would say the gravitonal potential energy is mass x gx the height. But let's say you wanted to know, for a specific roller coaster, how much energy WOULD there be at the top for any amount of mass. This would then just be g x the height of the roller coaster. This is something that could be considered \"gravitational potential\". It's not how much energy there is, but how much there can be for a certain amount of mass. 1kg has more energy at a 12 meter roller coaster than a 5 meter tall one, the same way 1 proton has more electrical potential energy at a point of 12V than 5V. This can be extended to circuits as well. In a rollercoaster, as it moves to points of lower \"gravitational potential\" that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, until it reaches a point of \"zero gravitonal potential\" (the ground) where all of that energy has been used. In a circuit, the current flows from points of high potential (positive battery terminals) to low potential (conveniently also called the ground) and as it does that all of it's energy is converted to other forms (often heat, but also light, kinetic, etc) via resistors or other components.",
        "When I teach intro circuits, I introduce electric potential (aka voltage) by analogy to fluid pressure. If a pressure difference exists between two points in a pipe, water will flow from high pressure to low pressure. Likewise, if an electrical potential difference exists between two points connected by a conducting path, then electric current will flow from high potential to low potential. Now, some caveats: 1. Thanks to Ben Franklin (who didn't know about electrons), conventional current flow in circuits is opposite the real movement of electrons, which would be from lower electric potential to higher electric potential. 2. Voltage changes in a circuit generally propagate much faster than pressure changes in water. 3. Even though electricity moves very quickly, the electrons themselves only move a few millimeters per hour in a circuit . The slight shifts of the electrons closer together or further apart are what carry energy and information through a circuit. There's about \\~10\\^22 atoms free electrons in a gram of copper wire, for example, so even small shifts can have very noticeable macroscopic effects.",
        "If you look at the potential energy of a charge q sitting a distance r from another charge Q, the expression is PE = kQq/r. Now, you can stare at that and say that there are two contributions in that expression, which I'll separate by parentheses: PE = (kQ/r)(q). What I'm trying to convey is that there is a factor in that multiplication that has to do with how the charge Q has *changed that place* at a point r away, and there is a factor that has to do with the size of the charge q you put in that place. It's like each part has a role in contributing to the potential energy. The part that is a feature *of that place* is called the potential. It is simply a map of some physical property of each location, over all locations. In a circuit, it's the same thing: a map of a property of each location in the circuit, a number that we measure in volts. Yes, it *might* be due to all the other charges in the circuit, but that's not the only way there can be a value (in volts) of potential at that place."

Geometrically, you'd see that when the two spaceships meet going at different speeds, in the frame of reference of the spaceship going away, the central section of the Earth timeline would appear to happen after they met with the other spaceship, and in the frame of reference of the other spaceship, the same section would appear to happen before they met the first spaceship, meaning none of the spaceship lived through that section of time while being measured by the clock. (Remember that c is finite, so of course when they meet they physically see Earth at the same point on the timeline, but that's Earth in the past, they will both see the central section of the timeline later and the discrepancy will arise when they project what they see on Earth on their own frame of reference) Now imagine you have several spaceships, not two, instead of a big central gap you get many small gaps, which add up to the time missing on the clock on the spaceships. When you push this to the limit of infinite spaceships, going each at an infinitesimally faster or slower speed than the previous one, with infinitely small gaps between the timeline covered by clocks on different frames of reference. If you integrate over those infinitely small gaps you get again the time missing from the clocks on the spaceships. This is equivalent to having one object, or one twin, changing frame of reference constantly while accelerating.",
        "To put it simply, acceleration breaks the symmetry. If you ignore the acceleration part of the journey (the twin turning around), you can define a reference frame where the twin in the spaceship is stationary, but the twin on earth is moving. Since both reference frames are valid, it seems like a paradox. Acceleration breaks the symmetry, since no matter what reference frame you define, it'll find that the twin on the spaceship underwent acceleration.

        "My understanding is that this was initially thought a plausible idea due to the discovery of rapid inflation of the early universe to explain why the universe appears pretty homogenous. I think it related to the initial quantum conditions too that led to the idea that more than one fluctuation could occur and hence a bunch of bubble universes could have been formed with their own physical constants laws etc. I think was some idea that perhaps looking at the CMB it might be possible to detect these other universes bumping against each other in some sense, though I don't think statistically it showed this occurring and everywhere was smooth. I think it had some theoretical mathematical quantum framework initially so not entirely philosophy.",
        "The multiverse idea, though unprovable currently, (offc it's my personal opinion) it helps explain some puzzling aspects of our universe. It's like having a backup plan for when things get tricky. While it's not solid science yet, it's more of a \"what if\" scenario that scientists find interesting or ill say intriguing, even if it's a bit like pondering what's beyond the horizon, which is unknown. So, it's kind of like a science-philosophy mix, offering some cool fodder for thought, i guess idk. [It's what I think after taking into accounts the interviews of some well known scientists, so yea that's what I think:) ]",
        "The problem is that while quantum mechanics is mathematically coherent and explains the evidence, humans tend to want to put things into stories which are the main lens through which they see the world. The nature of quantum mechanics is such that whatever story you wrap around it, has to be quite strange and out of line with out everyday experience, to the extent that many words is arguably one of the less weird stories (physicists usually call these \u201cinterpretations\u201d, largely because it sounds more formal and they don\u2019t want to admit their discomfort with the maths). It\u2019s not necessarily unprovable though. If quantum mechanics is a complete description then it\u2019s not possible to distinguish between any of the interpretations. But quantum mechanics appears to only be an approximation still, as it doesn\u2019t properly gel with relativity. If quantum mechanics is an outcome of a broader theory and physical reality, it could be the case that when discovered we are able to prove or disprove many worlds.",

If you don't want multiple worlds, you need to invent new concepts like particles riding on pilot waves, or wave function collapse. As an analogy, infinitely large universe is the simplest answer to the question \"what exists beyond the observable universe\". It does not intuitively seem like a \"minimal\" explanation, but it is, in the sense that it doesn't require any special boundary conditions.",

Perhaps this is a pathology that we run into when our theories break down, like singularities. I wouldnt say I'm convinced there really is a multiverse. I think we still have a few directions to explore before we really need to hypothesize one.",
        "I know exactly what you mean. As others have mentioned, its an interpretation. But one that seems indeed popular among scientists. One example that comes to mind is Lev Vaidman from TSVF. It is often also popular to refer to it as the Everettian approach. My own problem with many world interpretation: It is boring. The fact that the different branches of the universe do neither interact nor interfere makes it boring and unfalsifiable (Edit: I really was a bit too quick with this term, as was pointed out in the comments..) What does it matter if there is a gazillion other worlds if there is absolutely no interaction possible. However I have proposed a theory, how the branches could show interference. If they would converge to the same state in the final evolution of the universe (heat death, big rip, big cruch, etc). Then interfernce could happen in this state. I also claim that this potential interference could change probabilities of events at present time, just like interference normally does if appearing locally. I wrote about it here in detail:",
        "Let me propose a more \"intuitive\" (if not necessarily scientific) reason why the multiverse or many-worlds idea should be considered the default assumption, until otherwise disproven (if indeed disproving it is even possible). Basically, one could describe the lifetime of an individual as the process of coming to successive realizations that there isn't just one of ... anything. (The following is a very loose and general description): A newborn baby in mother's arms soon learns that \"Mother\" is not the only \"other\". There also exists \"not-the-mama\", who is basically just another form of the same thing. Then the baby eventually (surprisingly?) realizes he's not the \"only\" object of his parents' care and love - rather he has brothers and sisters that are just more instances of himself, with different attributes. Ok, so once the baby has understood about \"family\" he has it all figured out: \"The Family\" is all there is. But he'll soon learn that there are other families out there, basically the same as his but with different attributes. Again, he has it all figured out finally: these \"families\" constitute a community, his neighborhood. Got it. The neighborhood is certainly all of existence. But wait, getting older he realizes that there are actually multiple neighborhoods, making up the \"City\", his city. You see where this is going. More learning leads to further realization of the obvious, that if there's one of something there can be and most probably are more of the same. Why should there be just one? Cities to country, countries to planet... So Mother Earth was once assumed to be the only one of its kind. But somewhere along the way humans found we aren't the only planet, some of those lights up there were just more of the same, and circling around the big one, the Sun. And certainly \\*the Sun\\* is unique of course. Very obvious. Until we realized it's not, all the other points of light up there are basically more instances of the same thing, other \"solar systems\" with different attributes. So, the stars are all there is, right? Well... wouldn't you know it, all those stars are just part of our galaxy, which is certainly the only one, until we found many more of the same instances scattered all throughout the universe. So, now, finally, after much experience, we've finally arrived at the one unique entity: the Universe! Surely there is only one, right? Certainly there are not more of the same, why would we ever think that?"

      "output": [
        "It depends on what you are mixing. The order of speed for distribution is: salts (or other ion forming compounds), soluble solids, miscible solvents (and other liquid solutions), mutually dissolving solvents, gasses. Salts quickly dissolve and actively try to space themselves out in solution due to their high osmotic pressure and self repellence. Soluble solids dissolve fast though they can sometimes dissolve so quickly in the bottom of a beaker that they raise the density and cause a separate layer to form. They do not have the same self repelling force that salts do when dissolved so they do move a little slower. Next is liquid solutions and solvents, which both often have different viscosities and densities than water (or another solvent). This can cause them to take a minute to dissolve fully (as seen when ethanol is added to water; best seen with dark liquor and water) or form a separate layer despite being miscible (as seen occasionally with ethanol and often with honey). This further can be seen when dropping food coloring into water as the dyes used are extremely colored so there is almost none in the water and it would take a long time for it to diffuse through osmotic pressure alone. Past this point it may take more than some light shaking to mix the components well. Mutually dissolving solvents refers to solvents like the water-ether system, where water and ether can dissolve each other but are not miscible. These solutions are hard to get to even dissolve and the ether has very little osmotic pressure. It is also incapable of hydrogen bonding so it continually runs into water molecules that are hydrogen bound, breaking these bonds along the way to full distribution. These systems almost always have large density differences. Last is (non polar) gasses, and this mostly comes down to their poor solubility and very low density. This means they always dissolve at the top of a solution and always try to stay there. This last one is especially noticeable because our oceans do not have consistent oxygen concentrations even a kilometer apart. In contrast to salt you have to go thousands of km to see a noticeable difference."

When you solve the dispersion relation, you\u2019re essentially doing a matrix eigenvalue problem in terms of w and k (frequency and wavenumber). There\u2019s a spectral theorem that says if you diagonalize a Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are always *real*; if both k and w are real then you get no damping; the plane wave looks like exp(i k x - i w t), so you need an imaginary component in k or w to get absorption (and thus exponential decay). As a dumb one-day of seeing this, if you w = v k and v is purely real, then if w is real then k is real, etc. Adding an extra complex term to Maxwell\u2019s equations changes the eigenvalue problem so it\u2019s not Hermitian anymore, so you can get complex eigenvalues.

Look up vortex shedding on YouTube and you'll find some decent animations. The pressure inside the car increases and decreases rapidly, creating the vibration you hear and often feel. The reason this js dampened by someone putting their hand out window is because their arm disrupts the flow of the vortex and therefore reduces the oscillation. You can also dampen it by lowering the front window, which usually has an angled front pillar. The angle is important because it spreads out the vortex profile so that it doesn't oscillate.",
        "Really if you look at how whistles work, it's basically the same principle. Air flowing past the window causes a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the car. Once this difference is large enough, it stalls the flow, causing the preesure to equalise. Once this has happened, the flow can cause another pressure difference. It's basically a very low frequency whistle. Putting your arm in there causes more turbulence, scrambling and disturbing the flow more."

Sometimes they result in small changes, like slightly longer limbs or slightly curlier hair, and other times they have a big effect, like an extra set of limbs or eyes or whatever. Look up HOX genes to see how biology is flexible enough to allow for this kind of thing. Anyway, the changes in the organism are 'tested' by the world. Some changes may be beneficial, while some may be detrimental. For example, longer limbs might give it an edge while escaping from predators, and curlier hair might be better insulation for colder climates. If the changes are beneficial, they will help that individual survive and mate. In general, mutation that are beneficial to reproductive success, by definition, get reproduced. Those that are detrimental to reproductive success, by definition, don't. When looking at individuals, it doesn't seem to have much of an effect, but we are talking about populations of millions of organisms, over millions of years. Even a tiny statistical bias is significant in the long run. Basically, mutations are random and create changes in the individuals that have them. The good ones remain in the population and the bad one disappear from it. Also, thanks to sex, beneficial mutations from different individuals can be merged together. That is why sexually reproducing organisms will always be way more adaptive and successful than asexually reproducing ones. Evolution is the *natural* filtering of *random* mutations.

So when you smell apple pies and that activates the memory of your childhood and your grandma baking you some apple pie, that\u2019s engram activation for you. Some neurons related to the scent of apple pie receives signals which relays signals to the rest of the engram that holds the memory of apple pie, childhood, and grandma.

The second explanation is that blues and greens (which are often blue combined with a yellow pigment) are usually structural colors. Structural colors work by using a finely spaced pattern of ridges or crystals to selectively reflect certain wavelengths of light and not others. Structural colors seem to be pretty common in scales and feathers, but less so in hair. Perhaps there's something about the structure of hair that makes them more difficult to produce.

        "Everything we measure is a real number. [Adding an imaginary component] is a handy* way to insert some extra temporal information: how much out of phase you are with a reference sinusoid. If you're in phase, the imaginary component is zero, and the magnitude of the real component is the amplitude. If you're perfectly out of phase, the real component is zero, and the magnitude of the imaginary component is the amplitude. Example: A capacitor isn't Ohmic and doesn't have a real-valued resistance like a resistor. The current that flows though it depends on the rate of change of the applied voltage, so it has a complex impedance: A sinusoidal applied voltage will result in an out-of-phase current. This is captured by an impedance of 1/j\u03c9C, with imaginary unit j, angular frequency \u03c9, and capacitance C. In this way, Ohm's law can be generalized to accommodate reactive\u2014not just resistive\u2014electronic components. *Handy because you can visualize the measurement as the y-value of a vector rotating in the complex plane at the signal frequency, and handy because you can translate a complex number into an exponential through [Euler's formula], with the exponential function being nice to work with because it's its own derivative.",
        "In this particular case, the complex number gives you information about the *phase* of a response relative to an input. If the conductivity is a positive real number, then the current waveform in the metal is going to be in phase with the applied electric field. If the conductivity is a positive imaginary number, then the current waveform in the metal is going to be 90 degrees out of phase with the applied electric field. If the conductivity is a negative real number, then the current waveform in the metal is going to be 180 degrees out of phase with the applied electric field (in other words, inverted). And if the conductivity is a negative imaginary number, then the current waveform in the metal is going to be 270 degrees out of phase with the applied electric field. Likewise, for general complex conductivities, the relative phase of the current waveform and the applied electric field will be equal to arctan(imaginary part of conductivity / real part of conductivity). You can think of any complex number as either (real part) + i\\*(imaginary part) or as (magnitude)\\*e\\^(i\\*phase). The latter description is most useful here, and it would definitely be worth getting familiar with it and thinking in terms of complex magnitudes and phases rather than real and imaginary parts. Anyway, one thing you can see immediately is that we ***can*** actually measure and observe a complex conductivity, since we can measure phase shifts between signals. (You could also do this with resistivity, but for historical reasons this is named something different, called the \"impedivity\", which is equal to resistivity + i\\*reactivity. It's still true that impedivity = 1/conductivity, in any case.) Now, as for the current vector: complex vectors do in fact exist, and there's no problem working with them and measuring them. It has three components, and each component is a complex number. The real part of each component corresponds to the magnitude of the part of the waveform that's in phase (or 180 degrees out of phase) with the corresponding component of the applied electric field, and the imaginary part of each component corresponds to the magnitude of the part of the waveform that's 90 (or 270) degrees out of phase with the corresponding component of the applied electric field. The fact that these two cases are enough to cover all possible phase shifts is a mathematical consequence of the way that the complex plane works. Once again, you can measure a complex current vector in the same manner: apply a known time-varying electric field vector, and measure the magnitude and phase shift of the current flowing in the x, y, and z directions. The magnitude and phase shift of the signal correspond straightforwardly to the magnitude and phase of the complex conductivity. There's one final thing here that's worth covering: if you've read over the current vector portion carefully, you'll notice there's a hidden assumption we've made. In particular, we assume that the current waveform in a particular direction *only* depends on the electric field *in the same direction.* Why should that be the case in general? Why couldn't we have a material that, when an electric field is applied to it, generates a current in a *different direction*? Well, it turns out that those materials actually do exist; to describe them properly, the conductivity has to be a *rank-2 tensor* rather than an ordinary complex number, where the nine components of the tensor are complex numbers describing the response of the material in each direction to an applied signal from each direction."

      "output": [
        "Super glue is primarily made of methyl cyanoacrylate. It's a small molecule, that will form long chains when exposed to moist surfaces. This process (polymerization) is what causes the glue to harden. It also releases heat. (Hence the burn feeling you get if you get super glue on your fingers). In this case, you're applying it to pop-corn, which is a foam-like material. This gives it a very high surface area. (And also makes it quite good at trapping heat.) So, there's a lot more surface available to initiate the polymerization reaction. It starts faster, releasing more heat. The heat further accelerates the reaction, which releases more heat, etc... (That's known as a \"thermal runaway\". It can be quite catastrophic when it happens on industrial scales...) So, the reaction happens faster, and the heat can't be evacuated as quickly. This means that by the time the glue is fully polymerized and the reaction stops, it will have gotten way hotter, apparently hot enough to visibly release cyanoacrylate vapours in your case. (The boiling point of methyl cyanoacrylate is only 49\u00b0C) &#x200B; There are two ways you can mitigate that: \\-The obvious one is to cool down the pop-corn and glue beforehand. The freezer will do best, as cyanoacrylate won't freeze above -40\u00b0C \\-Some brands of super-glue use different cyanoacrylates, that don't heat up as much when polymerizing and don't evaporate as easily. Ethyl cyanoacrylate based ones should be easy to get (Krazy glue I think? Check the package to be sure), but the difference with the methyl cyanoacrylate isn't that high I think, so it may not be enough. Otherwise, n-butyl cyanoacrylate and octyl cyanoacrylate should heat up a lot less. These are used as medical adhesives, you may be able to purchase them in a pharmacy, though it could be pricey. (Check the brand names on the Internet, pharmacists are unlikely to make the link with the name of the chemical...) &#x200B; As to whether you should be worried about breathing the vapours, I'd say yes. Cyanoacrylate fumes are unlikely to do your lungs any good. It's best to do stuff in a well ventilated room if it gives off a lot of vapour."

        "Monotremes have only been found in South America and Australia (I'm including New Guinea because it's geologically associated). They were reasonably widespread in both places during the Cretaceous period and the early Paleogene. It's likely that one day we will find fossils in Antarctica, which was connected to both of the other continents during part of that interval. So there was never a time when they could be considered as the most successful mammal group globally. When marsupials reached the southern continents, they seem to have undergone a decline in diversity. If there were an island with no other mammals, they probably would not occupy all of the niches theoretically available, at least not quickly. They are not as good at thermoregulation as other mammals. Their gait is less efficient, so fast running would take some major changes. Combine less efficient with locomotion with reliance on eggs, and you limit the amount of mobility that a female has during parts of the reproductive cycle--they can't just carry their young with them, tying them to a nest. Based on those factors, I don't think a world without placental mammals would just have monotreme analogues for all the forms we observe among placentals. Some, yes, but not all."

Basically, why are there so many plants? Why don't herbivores eat more of them? You see people propose that plant chemical defenses are the driving factor, or that control of herbivores by predators and disease is the driving factor.  It's hard to nail down global phenomena like this, but there's definitely some evidence that control by predators can keep herbivores (including insects) in check. See [this paper] as an example. It's worth noting that it doesn't _have_ to be this way. Especially in aquatic ecosystems you can find situations where algae biomass is eaten almost as fast as it is produced.",
        "This is a really deep and interesting topic I have been reading into for years! Here is my non-exhaustive list of a couple of contributing factors: 1) Well sometimes the bugs do eat all the plants! But in the long-term this is not an evolutionarily sound strategy so it not selected for 2) Everything eats bugs, they are the very bottom of the food chain. Birds, fish, lizards, amphibians, invertebrates, and other bugs. Massive blooms of insects are regularly kept in check within existing ecosystems. 3) Herbivores, especially insects, rarely kill plants. Most of the time they only eat a small part like the leaves, stem, or roots and function more like parasites than predators. 4) Most plants also reproduce quickly. All sorts of plants produce hundreds to thousands of seeds. So when swaths of vegetation are destroyed, some species are back by next year. 5) Monocultures of identical plants are vulnerable to being wiped out by insects but the *diversity* of plants and plant defenses means no one bug can eat all the parts of all the plants. 6) Bugs kinda already are eating everything? By biomass the primary herbivore in every terrestrial ecosystem? Bugs. The primary carnivore by biomass in every terrestrial ecosystem? Usually ants. I believe in some ecosystems ants are both the largest herbivores and carnivores by biomass. One last note is that \u201cbugs\u201d the insects, arachnids, and mollusks are evolution\u2019s golden children. They have all been an integral part of terrestrial ecosystems for longer than tetrapods have had legs. Small size and quick generations make them extremely resilient to mass extinctions and able to quickly fill very diverse niches. Dragonflies have been toot-tooting their way through **4 out of the 5** \u201cbig\u201d mass extinctions virtually unchanged. They are far more adapted and evolutionally \u201cperfect\u201d to live on this planet than any mammal."

      "output": [
        "It means the system is in a state to do work. To use gravity as an example, a mass m has higher potential at height h than on the ground. You have to expend energy (do work) to get from the lower potential state to the higher state. That energy is stored as potential energy. If the mass falls to the ground, the energy is converted from potential energy to kinetic energy, or it could be harnessed in some other way",
        "Potentials have long been a mathematical trick for calculating conservative fields (they derive from a \u201cpotential\u201d). The most notable potentials are V the scalar potential and A the vector potential which are used in electromagnetism to solve the Maxwell\u2019s equations like this: **E** = \u2013 grad V \u2013 \u2202**A**/\u2202t and **B** = curl **A** . But potentials are in fact not just a mathematical trick but something more fundamental than the field strengths! In Quantum Field Theory by example you will often see potentials and rarely field strengths. But it is like that even in classical theories. Look at the first chapter of Robert Wald\u2019s book \u201c*Advanced Classical Electromagnetism*\u201d to understand why it is like that. Chapter 1 available here in free preview : [Advanced Classical Electromagnetism | Princeton University Press]",
        "Potential is the amount of energy available between two points [and here comes the important bit] per unit of the quantity relevant to the type of potential. So gravitational potential is energy per unit mass, J/kg in SI units. Electric potential is energy per unit charge, J/C (coulomb), better known as a volt. The part about being per unit quantity is what separates potential from potential energy.",
        "I think of potential energy as the energy described by the static state of the system, i.e. the energy due to the positions of all of the particles in a system and their forces on each other. Whereas kinetic energy would be the energy of the dynamic state of the system, which would be due to the relative velocities of all of the particles in the system",
        "I'm going to use the general label U for potential (don't get confused if you see U used for other quantities in physics). U is some function over all space, so it is really U(X), where X denotes some place. If you compare U(X) and U(Y), there will probably be a difference, called a potential difference, between those two places (U(Y)-U(X)). Now that we have that, if you put something at X and move it to Y, it will experience a change in potential energy. If U is electrical potential, then the change in potential energy will depend on two things: a) the charge q that you put at X and move to Y, and b) the change in potential U(Y)-U(X). If U is gravitational potential, then the change in potential energy will depend on two things: a) the mass m that you put at X and move to Y, and b) the change in potential U(Y)-U(X).",
        "Potential is a description of the space around something. When you put something in a potential, it has potential energy. The analogy I like best is gravitational potential. If you have a boulder on a hill, it has potential energy, and it will tend to roll down the hill, exchanging the potential energy for kinetic energy. If you take the boulder away, the hill is still there. You can map out the topography, and look at where you have hills and valleys, and the slope of the landscape. When you do this, the height map is (essentially) the potential. If you know how objects interact with the potential, you can trace out how they will move in the potential. Gravitational potential near earth's surface is the height of things multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. Since the acceleration due to gravity is mostly constant, the height determines the potential. Going farther away, looking at something like the solar system, the potential is determined by where mass is clumped up. Clumps of mass make valleys in the potential; the more mass there is, the deeper the valley. The more dense the mass is, the steeper the valley. For electric potential, potential is determined by where charge is clumped up. Clumps of positive charge are hills, clumps of negative charge are valleys. When there is a lot of charge, the hills are higher or the valleys are deeper. When the charge is concentrated, the slope is steep, and when its more spread out the slope is more gradual. The major difference from gravity is that there are positive and negative charges, and like charges repel instead of attracting. So positive charges will fall downhill while negative charges will fall uphill. For cells, the potential is again related to the concentration of charge, although usually it's specific ions. The ions will tend to move to areas with a lower concentration, and are usually prevented by cell walls. So you have hills and valleys again, but now there is a gate that blocks the free motion up or down the hill.",
        "For a mathematical understanding, I would suggest looking at helmholtz theorem. It essentially suggests that any vector field can be represented as a sum of the negative gradient of a scalar \"potential\" and the curl of a vector \"potential\". This would explain why you're seeing potentials literally everywhere... it's because literally any vector function (field) you have is a vector derivative of a function that we call the potential."

The LHC can store about 1 nanogram of protons.

So all other organs were still healthy enough to keep on going, but the brain wasn't. It basically means the person is gone, but likely the family doesn't want to let go, yet."

        "The A1c cutoffs are based on studies which determined the level that was associated with negative consequences (e.g. damage to your vessels). Many individuals with type 2 diabetes who make lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise, dietary discretion) and are adherent to their medications are able to reduce their A1c below 6.5%. If their blood glucose remains within target ranges, they are considered to be in remission. Despite that, they remain susceptible to relapse if they are no longer adherent to their changes. It's also important to recognize the distinction between \"cure\" and \"remission\". Cure means that all traces of the disease are completely gone, with essentially no chance of coming back. Remission means that there is no detectable evidence of disease, but there is still a high chance of relapse. In terms of cancer, someone who completes treatment without any detectable evidence of disease is in \"complete remission\". After 5 to 10 years depending on their cancer, they are often considered \"cured\". An individual with Type 1 diabetes cannot be cured, and remission is very difficult to the point of it being nearly impossible. Remission in type 2 diabetes is achievable with active lifestyle interventions (primarily weight loss) and adherence with medications (such as metformin)."

This lower energy region is more stable than our higher energy state, so the lower state grows, spreading out at the speed of light. This would be a random event, a certain region of space falls into a lower energy state, and that state spreads out at the speed of light. To us outside of this sphere it would look like a volume of space that suddenly gets a lot hotter than its surroundings. This might sound backwards: if the vacuum decay region has a lower energy shouldn't it be cooler? But here's the thing, energy must be conserved, so all that excess energy must be converted into heat in the new, lower energy vacuum. If you depicted this on a sheet of paper, it would look like a red disc that grows larger over time (red meaning higher than normal temperature). A *bubble of nothing* is similar, but instead of a red region getting bigger and bigger, it is like you are cutting a disc out of the paper instead of colouring it in. There is no space at all inside of a bubble of nothing. Of course in the real world it would be 3D, not a sheet of paper, but it is easier to picture cutting a whole in some paper. You shouldn't worry, we can't cause these things to happen. In theory a particle collision could precipitate such a change of state, but particles hit the atmosphere from space with much higher energy than we could produce in particle colliders, and particles hit neutron stars with much higher energy than that, and yet the universe hasn't collapsed into nothing, so I wouldn't worry."

        "In ligand field theory, the energy splitting of the metal centers d-orbitals is described as a result of repulsive electrostatic interactions between the electrons of the donor atoms and the d-electrons. You mentioned the octahedral ligand sphere so I will use this as an example. For easier imagination, think of the ligands donor atoms as being point charges. In the octahedral ligand sphere, there are two point charges located on the z axis at (0 0 Z) and (0 0 -Z) relative to the metal center. The remaining 4 point charges are located in the xy plane at (X 0 0), (-X 0 0), (0 Y 0) and (0 -Y 0). Ultimately, the donor atoms are aligned with the lobes of dz^2 and dx^2-y^2. Therefore, due to electrostatic interactions dz^2 and dx^2 -y^2 are raised in energy and the remaining d orbitals are stabilized. This explains the splitting into the stabilized eg niveaus (dxy, dxz, dyz) and the destabilized t2g niveaus (dz^2 , dx^2 -y^2 ). This concept can be transferred to any other ligand field geometry. Try to rationalize the 3 dimensional arrangement of the donor atoms relative to the d orbital geometry and you will understand the resulting orbital splitting. To answer your question on why this happens: The assignment of coordinates is essentially just convention. The donor atom orbitals and the metal center orbitals have to align linearly to achieve the best possible orbital overlap. Therefore, in the idealized model of the octahedral (or any other) complex geometry we assume that the ligands arrange in a manner that ensures linear orbital overlap as well as maximum distance between the donor atoms to minimize repulsive interactions between the donors valence electrons."

Class status is not just about current income. Social scientists debate the best way to define it, but most argue for some combination of income, wealth, status, education, and neighborhood or region. Having a temporary period of low income as an adult is not the same as growing up in poverty and having limited life chances and a greater exposure to adverse life events like periods of hunger, neighborhood violence, and so on. [Neighborhood] is really a [bigger predictor] of life outcomes than individual family circumstances. We also have to pull apart the causes of violence. The biggest predictor of violence is not class or poverty, it is being male. So we really have to look at what we are defining as violence and how the police interact with neighborhoods and treat different kinds of violence. A kid in a low income school with a zero tolerance policy on violence can end up with an arrest for a normal school fight, while a wealthy man or a cop who beats his wife and/or kids everyday may never be arrested. In 2008, 346 people died in plane crashes when Boeing put out a faulty plane that was incorrectly regulated. No individual was ever held responsible, and it was not defined as violence. So the picture is more complicated than we generally think about. And finally, thinking about unplanned or unintended pregnancy is complicated. What do we mean by unplanned pregnancy and when do we think it is a problem? About 5% of pregnancies per year are [unintended], a rate much higher than other high income countries. About 25% of them are among non-poor women, and younger women are more likely to have unintended pregnancies. So some part of this is explained by US policy, some part by age, and some part by poverty.

His point was basically, that when you interact with a community you're not part of the loudest and most vocal will become what you consider the archetype.

In Myanmar specifically, this public discretion was only encouraged by ~60 years of authoritatianism. Smiling doesn't always mean 'im happy' or 'I want to be friends.' I wonder if it might be that people seem happier to you, but are being more forthright about their actual emotional state when surveyed. A published source that treats this is Geertz's essay From the Natives Point of View. It's considered out of date, and should be taken with a big grain of salt in terms of accuracy, but it's useful as a sketch to think about how differences in behavioral norms or experience can be observed and described. As well, I think there's a bit of a correlation\u2260causation issue with the connection you're making between antidepressant use rates and reported happiness in Scandinavia. It could be that using antidepressants cause people to report being happier; it could be that more robust public health care leads to higher rates of medication use and independently makes people happier; there could be no correlation relationship but just coincidence, etc. As well, \"uppers\" usually refers to stimulants, not antidepressants (except for bupropion, which is an atypical antidepressant that acts like a stimulant)."

The short version is that it seems to be maybe a quiet small majority of people who have some kind of interest and openness to this kind of interacting, a tiny minority with the energy and life circumstances to go for it and stick with it, and another minority that's so steeped in doubt and anger that they'll come out swinging against these efforts even if they would actually want to see the same outcomes. Groups that do this kind of thing in real life and that have some kind of track record of success tend to do it in part by pulling people temporarily away from the environments and other people that reinforce their hostility. Examples look like: * * * That's harder to do online but not necessarily impossible. You can ask people if they're open to PM conversations, or focus your effort on smaller forums or in places that have more of a sense of personal relationship like locally oriented groups, group chat/Discord, or probably other options I'm not thinking of. Community standards also figure into it. Big tech platforms pretty much always start from the premise that more open discourse is always better, until they're forced to learn limitations and corner cases to that belief (see: [Hey Elon: Let Me Help You Speed Run The Content Moderation Learning Curve], or more academically, [You can't stay here: The efficacy of reddit's 2015 ban examined through hate speech] and other points from [this CMV]. This may interact with [C. Thi Nguyen's distinction between echo chambers and epistemic bubbles], in the sense that many users are driven by emotion and identity not just to seek out spaces where other voices are left out, but to work to shape the spaces around them so that voices they don't like are undermined. That behavior is allowed, so not only does it happen, but it can reinforce itself in multiple ways, although without one group clearly winning out, it [tends to lead to repeating dynamics of speech and counterspeech] as described in a previous /r/askpsychology comment. So there's a lot to recognize, if not to actively work against, in how the spaces themselves are structured."

Then the boys grow up the teens and then they're often encouraged to have sex and drink, do drugs, be macho. Sometimes their own family encourages the behavior. Sometimes it's just societal and peer pressure. How you grow up and your home environment really does play a huge part though. When I was in high school there'd be the football team of boys getting drunk/high around the time of football games. Wrecking their shit in football and needing knee surgery while still in high school in a blue collar town and needing painkillers. Then you'd hear about girls with helicopter parenting apps and parents who will text or call as soon as their parents see them literally do anything. Parents are usually more controlling of girls, especially in the rural conservative areas because of their whole mentality of \"boys will be boys\" and \" I hate women who use abortion as a contraceptive!\" Or other hateful and controlling things to say to guilt trip girls and women into even more subservience.

In the spirit of transparency I have flagged my own editorial points on the subject. Mods: I'll happily remove the editorial bits if it is deemed not appropriate here. Please just let me know **Scholarly point:** One really important thing that I think is often lost on people today is that the labor rights enjoyed by unions today were hard won over generations of struggle and attempts to repress that struggle, often with deadly violence. There are many articles about this but Lipold and Isaac provide a good overview in [\"Striking Deaths: Lethal Contestation and the \u201cExceptional\u201d Character of the American Labor Movement, 1870\u20131970\"]. **Editorial note:** I think the important thing to take away from this is that being part of a Union is carrying on a tradition of solidarity in which real people gave their lives for their fellow workers and for future workers. The struggles we face today, and the contracts we negotiate are as much for us as they are for those in the future and to honor those in the past. **Scholarly point:** Another important thing that is often lost to cultural memory is that there was a massive, far reaching social and economic policy shift in the 1970s and 1980s. These policy shifts overturned what has been referred to by Marglin and Schor as \"[The Golden Age of Capitalism]\". The prevailing policies from 1945-1970s in places like the US, UK, & Canada involved Keynesian Economic policies, but more importantly here a compromise between labor, business, and government referred to \"The Postwar Consensus\". See Dutton, David (1997).\u00a0British Politics Since 1945: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of Consensus\u00a0(2nd ed. Blackwell).Generally this was a form of corporatism (a somewhat misleading term) involving tripartite agreements between labor, business, and government where they would work together to form agreements and contracts that were fair and beneficial to all parties with a high degree of successful outcomes. Arguably this is a stark contrast to prevailing policies and cultural attitudes towards organized labor today. **Editorial note:** To me what is important here is that while people often tend to view the prevailing attitudes and policies towards organized labor as natural or inevitable, it is not the case that different policies and attitudes are possible and, in fact, prevailed for nearly half a century. There are real alternatives. The binary between capitalism and communism is a bit of a false one in that the Post-war Consensus/Golden age of Capitalism represents something in between.

        "Exposure therapist here. Check out the paper posted below that provides an interesting framework about exposure. You are correct blindly telling someone to say \"no\" to things could certainly be encouraging a safety behavior (i.e., avoiding anxiety producing situations by saying no), which will lead to more anxiety. However, a very common issue with folks with social anxiety is the fear that saying no will result in being harshly judged or rejected by others. Folks with this concern avoid saying no (and many times avoid expressing opinions, avoid disagreeing etc). Therefore, a great (and very common) exposure is to practice saying no or to disagree with others. Any good anxiety therapist should be trying to understand the function of saying no for each patient, as some people are avoiding by saying no and others are avoiding by NOT saying no. Lastly, if someone is doing actual exposure they would set up \"saying no\" in a systematic fashion, not just advise someone to just \"say no more\" (again see paper for more info about conducting systematic exposures). Moscovitch, D. A. (2009). What is the core fear in social phobia? A new model to facilitate individualized case conceptualization and treatment. Cognitive and Behavioral Practice, 16(2), 123-134.",
        "I think some of the confusion may be a lack of distinction between saying no to things that people ask of you vs saying no to opportunities or new experiences. That's not to say thay there is a clear line or no overlap, but it does matter what you are saying no to, especially in the context of the relationship and your life. Here's an example. Your friend asks you to drive them to work later. You have a car and the length of the drive is not unreasonable. Context 1: You haven't gotten a lot of time to spend with this frind lately and the ride could be an opportunity to catch up. You're not too busy. You say yes. Context 2: This friend has been asking you for rides and money a lot lately. You love and want to support them but are feeling like the relationship is one sided and want a break. You say no. Context 3: You friend works across from a new thrift store in town you want to check out. You say yes. Context 4: You promised you would see your sister at that time. She would understand if you were delayed to help a friend, but you don't get to see her a lot and would rather spend the time with her. You say no. In the different contexts there are different factors contributing to what degree saying yes is a burden and to what degree saying yes is an opportunity. I think the general idea is that there are many people who feel the need to please or help others or fear rejecting others, and that can lead to them saying yes to pravtically everything that is asked of them regardless of the context. The people who would have said yes to the ride on all four contexts above are the kind of people that this is aimed at. But yes you make a very valid point that saying no more often could also mean missing out on opportunitiea and at the extreme being stagnant."

It also isn't in any way limited to MENTAL health. A trip to the ophthalmologist can destroy the dream of becoming a pilot, a simple GP visit ideas about federal employment or military. Those options you mention also generally screen people for any health concerns that could make them unfit for the job or shorten their career. Whether or not all the conditions that are checked should be deal breakers or not is a different condition, but the diagnosis doesn't bring the issue into existence, it just gives them a name. Having the health issue is what prevents the career, not the diagnosis of it. While that will undoubtedly be unfair to some, screening for mental health issues in those positions is important. A pilot here in Germany was depressed an committed suicide by flying a commercial airplane full of passengers to their death, which sparked a lot of debates about how those things should be handled-in positions with such responsibility, the fear might be that someone who won't seek help fir fear of repercussions at their job might become an actual danger."

I would be careful to separate terms like \"abandonment\" and \"rejection.\" Some of the \"rejection\" may mix in with things like severe postpartum depression, which can impact a mother's emotional state and bonding with the infant.",
        "If you're asking simply why some mothers are unable to bond with their child, postpartum depression is a common cause of this. If untreated, it can last years. From a quick search: about 20% of parents don\u2019t feel an attachment immediately after their child is born. Some risk factors include difficult delivery, having a c-section, stress and exhaustion, baby having health complications, baby being separated from mother after birth, childhood that lacked positive parental models, previous mental illness, past miscarriage/loss of a child, lack of a social nerwork, marital abuse or problems. The social stigma around the issue undoubtedly doesn't help - parents are \"expected\" to immediately fall in love with their child, no matter that the reality is different for a significant number of them. There are some things parents can do to help bonding before and after birth, and more bonding strategies which can help when it doesn't happen right away, but a lot of parents don\u2019t know about them. For example, skin-to-skin contact with the baby in the first hour(s) after birth is extremely important, but IDK what the attitude is among the doctors in your country - here, some hospitals encourage it in as many births as possible including c-sections, while other act like it\u2019s unnecesary and the mothers who ask for it are just being \"difficult\". Of course, this is all \"why doesn't a mother feel close at all to her child\". It happens sometimes. Why does she go as far as abandoning him/her is another question. I imagine guilt, lack of a support structure, lack of information will all be factors. Where was her family/partner in all of this? My partner loves her son *now*, but her immediate reaction after he was born and in the following two or three months was \"I don't feel like he's mine\", \"I think I hate him\", \"don\u2019t leave me alone with him or I might hurt him\".

It produces much less (other kinds of) research when compared to other psychological theories though. As for answering your question, I'm from Brazil too. I guess it's more popular amongst older generations. Ours tends to favour CBT a bit sometimes more than before, but overall it isn't still nearly as popular as it, or other more traditional psychotherapies, like behaviorism, phenomenology, gestalt and existential psychology. But like anything, everything is a bit popular in my country. And, of course, among laymen, psychoanalysis heavily outweights other psychological theories in popularity. People usually know who Freud is at least, but often don't have any idea at all of whom Watson or Beck were, for example.",

This is a great example of why in the USA psychoanalysis is at best fading quickly and at worst dead.

Edited for clarity",
        "In my home state (USA) you must be a licensed clinician to enroll in a psychoanalysis program. To my knowledge the program is 5 years and part of that is being a patient yourself. I know someone who has completed it and was told they\u2019ve moved far away from Freudian stuff and are more client-centered. I don\u2019t know how effective it is but he is pretty successful in the area, contracting with the big 3 (automotive) to get clients for psychotherapy services (the clinicians at the firm are not psychoanalyst). In general you don\u2019t see it and there\u2019s a reason for that. The field of psychology has evolved a lot over the last century and it\u2019s always best to stick with the most up to date information, right? Additionally, psychoanalysis is extremely WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). Multiculturalism is big here and cultural humility is a big part of many psych programs."

I would never tell her she's the issue, that defeats the whole purpose of therapy which is realizing and improving your thought/behavior patterns yourself with guidance. She often told me stories about people abandoning her and I would ask questions until she had a shift in perspective, then explain the difference between the perspectives using terms I taught her in the psychoeducation phase.

        "I\u2019ve worked with a few folks with personality disorders, specifically antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders, in a community health setting (a clinic at a shelter in downtown LA). In my experience, therapists will see when the details are not adding up and that usually means a piece of the client\u2019s story is missing. But, it\u2019s our job to remain nonjudgmental. It may be that the client is omitting information, making up stories, etc. Or, it may be that that person has experienced immense trauma that has affected them in so many ways, one of them being that their perception of events is not always in line with reality. I agree with the commenter who wrote that we never tell our clients they\u2019re the problem, even when their behavior is problematic. But we also don\u2019t blindly support and encourage everything they do. It\u2019s a balance of warmth, openness, and challenging perceptions with clients and every therapist does this differently. I secretly hate this social media thing where people are saying the worst people you know are being told it\u2019s okay to be selfish sometimes in therapy. I think it discredits the value of therapy. Our job isn\u2019t to help people feel better about all the things they\u2019ve done in their lives. Our job is to help them meet their goals in a meaningful and authentic way that feels comfortable and fulfilling to them.",

I find some people more difficult to work with than others, or I find some people less sympathetic than others - which is normal and says more about me than them.

        "Interesting question - so typically the 1:1 interaction can actually be quite biased in BOTH directions, clients can be self centred OR very self-critical. As your only source of information its important to withhold judgement as you simply don't have the information. As others have said better than me - at the end of the day you're working with your client to improve their skills - luckily these skills aren't different if your client is the toxic on or not. (for example teaching someone reflective practise can be useful for all). The majority of problems that people have are somewhat interactional - e.g. there are things they could do better and things that those around them aren't doing great at (kinda just like the rest of us!) That all said it is true there is a small niche of abusive people who may try to use therapy to simply validate themselves and the only skills they want to learn are to better manipulative others. However (IMHO) these people are not typically easy to detect",

        "Other people have talked about the label \"toxic\". When we're talking about an actual person, there's always going to be more constructive and specific language to use. It's somewhat normal for \"interpersonal problems\" to be part of what a client is asking for help with. That phrasing is pretty safe to use to talk about it either as a general phenomenon, or if you're doing something like writing case notes or a treatment plan, to communicate about it with someone else like an insurer, a supervisor, or heaven forbid, a court if their case notes get subpoenaed (a possibility that *should* come up in informed consent as one of the possible reasons for breaching confidentiality, but that in practice probably often slips through the cracks). Some more specific terms: \"Countertransference\", which refers to the therapist's reaction to a client. It's an overloaded term and some specific senses of it mean a reaction due to the therapist's own unresolved stuff, which is pretty much always followed by advice to the therapist to get in their own therapy and deal with it so that they can be more even-handed with their client. There is *also* a parallel body of theory, research and best practices though that have to do with dealing with countertransference as a manifestation of the kinds of reactions that a client tends to provoke, in people around them in general, as a direct manifestation of who they are and what problems are lurking inside of them. This comes up in instances like developing a \"countertransference management plan\" to deal with a client who has been seen to behave in ways that would be more or less agreed in consensus reality to be ways that a lot of people would react to (ex: or in research that suggests that sometimes this is actually a useful hint about a client's inner conflicts that they haven't spoken about directly (ex: Those studies give some direct answers to whether this stuff is important to address: it is. The question then is exactly the one you've asked: how do you address it? One factor that can hinge on is whether the client's problematic way of being or acting is \"ego-syntonic\" or dystonic, which is a technical way of saying that it feels like part of who they want to be or not. Example recent study about it: - which also highlights that this can be somewhat of a separate dimension from whether it's a problem or not (the way I act could get me what I want but I could still realize and admit that it's dysfunctional). It's easier if it's ego-dystonic, and if they have insight into it: I recognize that this is a part of me I don't like, that I own, and that I want to change - then sure, that would reflect what motivational interviewing would refer to as a high state of change-readiness. There's a spectrum between that and the opposite: I lack insight, I think other people are the problem, and even if I *did* see any of this about myself, I might even think that it's a positive reflection on myself. Other people should strive to be more like me even or especially in this particular way that sometimes other people think is a problem about me. One thing that therapists tend to do differently than laypeople in response to something like this is that you don't drag someone kicking and screaming right from zero awareness of a problem or desire for change right across the line to implementing behavior change and sticking with it. So across from that kind of client who is much less change-ready, it would be a lot of recognizing strengths in other areas, calling out genuinely functional uses of the apparently counterproductive behavior, along with identifying discrepancies between desires and outcomes, and maybe *very* occasionally a direct challenge.

        "I understand the need for positive reinforcement and self discovery for patients, but sometimes a spade has to be called a spade. A wife who slaps a sleeping husband because of some internal frustration should be asked to stop vs. asking \u201cwhy do you feel like hitting him?\u201d, \u201cwhat else can you do instead of hitting him?\u201d or \u201ccan we have a plan for reducing frequency of slaps from 7 days a week to 2 days a week?\u201d.

Since domestic violence against men is in practice not considered \u201cserious/bad\u201d in California, they just put domestic violence in medical history but no follow up action. Apparently \u201copen palm slaps, few times a week\u201d isn\u2019t serious enough to get order of protection. Not sure, why the medical community wants this to escalate to something serious before a real intervention."

But they have a poor understanding of other cultures, poor social skills, and have a tendency to struggle with Logic or critical thinking skills. They have a hard time understanding how other people think, or feel. They are more likely to be religious, and drawn to certain careers. They tend to have a smaller presence in social careers, or academia. They are much more likely to believe in conspiracy theories.

        "[It is common throughout the world for the suicide attempt rate to be much higher than the suicide death rate.] The reason it is so much higher is because different methods vary in how likely they are to result in death. Generally, minors will have less access to more lethal methods (such as firearms) than adults do. High school students are also almost always living with other people, which means there are more opportunities for someone to intervene during or right before an attempt. [This study discusses age differences in suicide methods.] It doesn't include teenagers but that different methods are more common by age and gender. All of this to say it's expected that attempts will be much higher than deaths and that this is likely even more true for teenagers. Also, the suicide attempt to death rate would be lower. The main reason is the 9% statistic came from a survey and so that means anyone who actually died wouldn't be included. It's also the case that the strong majority of people who attempt suicide do not ever die from suicide (i.e. they get better) and that most people who died from suicide did so on their first try (which is more common among youth though the statistics on that are fairly old).

There are therapies that have been clinically proven to aid those with autism, like skills-based therapies that help teach them social skills and the like. You don't need treatment for HSP.

It is also a misunderstanding or myth that Maslow's needs are hierarchical. He never intended for these needs to be structured hierarchically. It is best to be viewed as a ladder where you can fall into multiple categories of needs being met or not met. I know that SDT has strong empirical evidence, suggesting that we indeed have a need to self-actualize. But self-actualization is a theoretic assumption and worldview.

      "output": [
        "A lot of the theory from this actually comes from case study and professional experience - as its hard to study this sort of thing empirically... just a caveat for the following. Experts believe that abuse isn't a mental health disorder, people who abuse are often coherent (even they aren't to their target in fact counterintuitively they want to present as potentially unwell to their targets as this increases the chance the target will tolerate the abuse) and intentional. What appears to be the case is that abusers have a combination of: Entitlement - e.g. having beliefs that they are owed special treatment, and deviation from that treatment is the abnormal thing and worthy of punishment. This is why abusers often blame their targets, because they see their target as failing to meet their special treatment as an attack from the target, so the abuse is actually a response to their own hurt. Dehumanization - this accompanies the above and they enable each other. It's hard to feel entitled to anything from someone you respect and see as human, therefore abusers minimize and dehumanize the experience of targets, often through sexism or other bigotry, and something other thinking with while distorted is still \"rational\" e.g. viewing children as not worthy of rights Emotionally stunted - this isn't always the case must almost always abusers are emotionally 'immature' (although I don't want to imply they need to grow up, as often abusers are fully grown its not really a maturity problem) abusers tend to avoid discomfort and bad feelings to the point of lashing out and tantruming, using others to soothe their own pain. They tend to avoid accepting painful thoughts and feelings often by using others. Like the entitlement when people prompt discomfort or unhappiness (e.g. by telling them they are being abusive) they see this as an attack and \"shoot the messenger\" rather than listen or change.

      "output": [
        "A couple of social reasons I can think of. First is the copy cat effect (Columbine was the first shooting where media made a huge thing out of it). Organizations like the American Psychology Association says there's a strong copy cat effect of mass shootings, and want to treat reporting like we report suicides, i.e. with as little information as possible. FBI is on the same track. Though the media is usually very happy ignoring this. &#x200B; Another reason might be that the definition of a mass shooting varies depending on what organization you ask. The legal definition of a mass killing was also changed in 2012 with the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012 changed that to 3+ dead instead (from 4+). The FBI used to define a mass shooting up until 2012 using the mass killing criteria (with guns obviously) as part of their definition, but I don't remember if they had additional filters on top of that. What's commonly reported by media nowadays is the figure from the Gun Violence Archive (4+ dead or injured by gunfire, not including the shooter, no other factors matter). FBI on the other hand went over to analyzing cases on a case by case basis and applying certain filters. They release their annual active shooter report every year. Casualties is not really a part of that definition, instead they look purely at the intent (e.g. a public shooting with random targets, with just 1 dead or injured, might very well make the list - I've even seen cases with 0 casualties make the list, because the intent was there). As an example of how much various definitions can vary, in 2021: Mother Jones lists 6 mass shootings, so does the Violence Project. Everytown for Gun Safety lists 27 mass shootings. The Gun Violence Archive lists 693 mass shootings. The Mass Shooting tracker lists 818 (basically same definition as the GVA but they also include the shooters in the casualty count). The FBI report for that year has 61 cases. This makes it a bit hard to compare with earlier years. The closest would probably be Everytown for Gun Safety because they still use 4+ killed as part of their definition, but they don't filter out things like gang violence or domestic violence (like Mother Jones and the Violence Project does, and so does the FBI in their annual reports). So depending if the FBI did that before, then you could compare those two (and would need to take population differences between 2012 and now into account as well, ofc). EDIT: Fixed some typos and restructured a sentence.",
        "So... I'm not an expert at the social science here, but I've spent many years researching the firearms/criminal side of this equation, and here's what I've come to believe: 1. We *really don't know* if such events are more common or not. Until the 1990's, it's very unclear how many of these events may have just been missed by the general, national press entirely. The best data source on this is probably Mother Jones's database, and it starts (iirc) in 1983. Since then, numbers go up and down. 1. Also note that the FBI changed their definition in like 2014 which increased the \"count\". So it's not quite apples and apples. 2. The counts from the BBC data appear to be based on the \"shooting tracker\" database, which... is *extraordinarily* misleading and captures a tremendous amount of incidents that nobody seriously considers to be \"mass shootings\". (And has shit-tier data integrity to begin with). 2. The media coverage that the columbine shooters got was extensive and... not unfriendly. For the next twenty years, virtually every young mass shooter was found to have been strongly affected by them. 3. It's worth noting here that not all mass shootings are the same. Very broadly, the categories might be: 1. \"The angry employee\". Usually committed by someone who was fired or about to be fired (often for being violent), and who was looking at their life sort of falling apart. (These often get blamed on economic conditions, but this is rarely the case). 2. The \"Angry Young man\". Generally committed by adolescents or those in their early twenties. Just people angry at the world. 3. Noteworthy is that relatively few mass shooters show signs of *actual mental illness.* While many of them are (unsurprisingly) likely suffering some sort of mental crisis, few would meet the DSM-IV requirements as being diagnosed mentally ill. (Exceptions exist, notably the Colorado Theater shooter). 4. Again, very broadly, it's important to understand that these events (as defined by Mother Jones) are *distinctly different* from most normal criminal activity and the overwhelming majority of homicide. Things that we could do to substantially reduce various sorts of criminal acts in general would probably do little to nothing to reduce mass shootings (same being true in reverse). 5. It's my belief that (I admit, this move into more opinion) that most every society has these people who just... can't get along. They do different things. In most Asian societies, they kill themselves. In Europe, I think a lot of them went and joined ISIS. Back 30 years ago, I think it was \"trendy\" (seriously) for them to be serial killers. Today? Get a gun and shoot up a school. The individualist nature of US society contributes, as does the limited social safety net and relative instability of life in general. Historical and long lasting cultural factors are a *thing* that's very hard to just remove from a population... Distrust in authority, grievance \"culture\", etc.  All of this combines together and once in awhile becomes explosive.",

We are fed this idea that the 'American Dream' exists and as we continue to be the richest country and only getting richer, the masses are not getting any of that wealth.

To promote a narrative and to keep those who are getting rich to maintain their riches by getting those in poverty to blame each other. What effects does the impoverished killing one another and blaming one another have on the rich who are already protected by security and the police? Absolutely nothing. These people feel safe because they are. The rich aren't the ones living in 'bad' neighborhoods. They are living in mansions in only the safest areas of the country. To be honest, America has not been great. America is just deteriorating day by day. As the FPTP system is set, America is pretty doomed to remain a chaotic country of doom and despair. With one party being so Hellbent on absolute chaos, the other party just needs to be a little less chaotic and do absolutely nothing to get votes..... because they are just 'less' chaotic.

        "Hopelessness. When people are hopeless they act irrationally and often strike out at others. We've got many factors in play in this country that create more hopelessness and all of them are addressable. Mental health funding IS a big part of it but far from the only part, since not all mass shooters have documented mental health histories. We live in a country with a declining quality of life: more and more people are struggling to get by because of bad economic policies, where many people can't access basic healthcare because it's simply too expensive. Income inequality is growing while the middle class shrinks. We are increasingly being taught (through what we see on TV and online) that there's no middle ground, that extremism in one form or another is the only way. We've increasingly lost our sense of community and brother/sisterhood. Addiction is rampant, which we \"address\" by making it more difficult for people who need prescription medications to obtain them, rather than by making it possible (affordable) for people with substance abuse disorders to receive proper treatment. We have more people in prisons in this country than anywhere else in the world, very often for nonviolent offenses, and the prison systems here often do nothing to actually help people be productive/successful members of society when they get out. Hate is growing in this country, fueled mostly by the far right but to a lesser extent by the far left as well. There's a continuing push against any form of legislation to keep the most dangerous guns off the streets. Conspiracy theories are circulating like never before, encouraging paranoia and overall negative thinking.

Maybe some people feel short term gratification is enough (and delaying it causes unnecessary/uncomfortable tension). Maybe it is all about delaying gratification- but the fact that the study(s) don\u2019t elaborate and look at the assumptions is a bit on the nose.

        "This would.be a better question for ask historians however I'll try my best with my poli sci BA. Opposition to communism in terms of foreign and domestic policy is best understood by the doctrine of [containment]- reducing or blocking the growth of the soviet sphere of influence.\u00a0 This policy is best explained in what's known as [the X Paper] by Kennan, a US diplomat who coined the strategy. The X paper became a sort of declaration of Cold War, laying out the rationale for a policy of Containment. This was highly influential as it provided an answer to the US governments anxiety about the Soviet Union post world war 2. \u00a0 To summarize Kennan's thesis: 1. War between UK/US and the Soviet Union would be suicide, the US and its allies would not win a military victory 2. The soviets have become illogical and not willing to cooperate, preferring a Russian centered world order and view point 3. This view point is inherently incompatible with the western liberalism that underscores the US's system of government and trade 4. Communism is the ideology the soviets use to spread their sphere of influence 5. Therefore, to survive as a nation, the US must beat the Soviet Union by combating the spread of communism. While still a military threat, isolating the Russian Sphere of influence would make armed conflict highly unlikely. So in short, opposition to communism is best understood as opposition to Russian influence in world events rather than just a battle between economic systems. * we could say something about the influence of big business on US foreign policy but imho it would be overstated. As seen in Kinzer's *All the Shah's Men* the UK and US at first rebuffed BP's plea to intervene to stop their oilfields from being nationalized. It wasn't until a spurious connection to the Soviets was, er, invented did the US state department take interest in Iran.",
        "You're simply confusing two very different ideas from the Cold War itself and the post-Cold War era. During the Cold War basically no one thought that communism would fail the way it did. Everyone knew that communism was stable and would last indefinitely into the future and that the USSR would converge with US living standards, making the USSR the largest economy on Earth by the beginning of the 21st century. The Warsaw Pact was militarily stronger than NATO and it was widely understood that NATO relied on MAD nearly exclusively due to this understood disparity in military power. After the end of the Cold War, many people were completely shocked to see just how poorly the Warsaw Pact states were actually doing. This completely changed how the entire system was viewed, the conversation in academia became about how to transition these states to a new economic system. The [classical Soviet-type economy] was entirely and completely discredited. Some recent work has modified these criticisms with a focus on a post-60s malaise due to the fast growth in the post-war boom. [Most economists would view the pre-malaise growth as being due to education and a very high level of investment.] There is another way to view this: were all these actions actually necessary? Did they actually make any sense? Those are far more difficult to answer, I suspect that they ultimately didn't shorten the Cold War or actually make any sense, hardly unprecedented in government policy. Maybe it was all a sideshow. Maybe the US interventions were completely and totally unnecessary, I would even suggest that most of the \"economic gains\" to the US from these actions have been overstated dramatically.",
        "The USA attempts to police the entire world. It is not just Communists and Socialists in its firing line. &#x200B; It is hard to even summarise the USA's foreign involvement, as it is so expansive. Though here are some places to look: &#x200B; * The [hundreds (and at one point thousands) of military bases on foreign soil]. [See an incomplete list here]. * [See a list of USA involvement in regime change]. * [Funding international organisations]. [See an example here]. Many of these organisations cover areas of the world which are nowhere near the USA mainland. * The USA has the CIA, which according to itself [is a specialist intelligence agency for foreign affairs]. While it is hard to know exactly what it spends its money on, its budget is immense being [$ 52.6 billion in 2013]. Which is 3.25 % of the entire federal budget ([using the official statistic of $ 1,617,515,199,604 at the time of writing this.] &#x200B; So all in all, the USA is just involved in everything. &#x200B; Also, the other Western countries don't really initiate a whole lot in aggressive foreign policy these days. They just sometimes support the USA on its projects. &#x200B;",
        "Hi! I have a history degree and follow US politics frequently. If you want to understand why communism and socialism (but especially communism) are labeled bad in western countries, you need to look into the red scare (and red purge) after WW2. It affected a number of countries quite significantly (and actually resulted in the collapse of a quite functioning socialist society in Japan). While it's mostly labeled as a response to Russia, it was really a ploy used by the right to create a foothold in [American] and [Japanese] politics. Interesting stuff. Another answer is imperialism. It's easier to control other places if we can put in our own dictators (the banana republics[bananas] are kind of a good example, Cuba). My opinion is that they aren't inherently flawed, we see them executed to some degree with universal healthcare and safety nets. The west (primarily the US nowadays) prefers to undermine them in other countries because it gives them control. You don't want your territories voting you out lol"

I don\u2019t know that I agree that traits can\u2019t be changed, but if I\u2019m steal-manning the argument then I would say that it\u2019s a lot harder to change the motivation (push or pull) to behave in a certain way, but relatively easier to change your reaction or response to the motivation and behave differently than for what the trait is pulling. For example, someone might be more introverted than extroverted. Introversion generally pulls for more self-isolating behaviors across situations, contexts, and time. Therefore, this person is liable to self-isolate across the lifespan, but that doesn\u2019t mean that that person cannot be aware of that trend and choose to behave more socially as needed.

We are capable of change, both evidenced by psychosocial studies as well as something called [neural plasticity].

        "There's a strong case to be made that most of it is social rather than due to evolution. One study found that much of the gender difference could be accounted for by the person's \"hostile sexism score.\" People who score higher on hostile sexism are more likely to believe that feminism has gone too far and that women seek power over men. Men who score higher on the dark triad are also likely to score higher on hostile sexism to the point that it erases most of the gender difference. More broadly, many of the traits that relate to the dark triad (power over others, ambition/confidence, and hiding weakness) are all things associated with traditional masculinity (in the US and similar countries). While the opposite traits of empathy and nurturance are associated with traditional femininity. Generally, a man who acts in a more power-hungry way will get awarded more than a woman who does so or punished if they don't. The following study found this where men who acted more agreeablely experienced a backlash. If men receive praise for acting in more aggressive ways while being punished for being empathetic and agreable then they're likely to end up scoring higher on the dark triad than if they grew up in a society where that wasn't the case. Vice versa for women. It's important to note too that the good majority of dark triad research takes place in a select few countries (WEIRD ones) and generally focuses on young college students.",

As Gramsci stated, the ideas of the ruling class become the ideas of society. This means that the more psychopathic you are, the higher you tend to rise in capitalist society; psychopathology itself is encouraged and nurtured by this backward mode of production. Because capitalism is also fundamentally patriarchal (since its beginnings during the enclosure period in England, capitalism has had nothing but contempt for women), this means that men tend to be more psychopathic. In the long period of primitive communism which lasted for hundreds of thousands of years (liberals refer to primitive communists as \"hunter-gatherers\"), women were generally in control and psychopathology was discouraged if not nonexistent since the concept of private property did not exist and there was nothing to be psychopathic **about**.

Note that your examples of poor religious states are all from the South. If we look at the rest of the country, the pattern doesn\u2019t seem to hold up. North Dakota, Alaska and Nebraska are all in the top ten for GDP per capita and Texas and Utah are in the top 20. All of these but Alaska are, according to Pew, above-average in religiosity. However, Utah is barely so and has a different majority religion, and the other four owe much of their wealth to fossil-fuel deposits. Maine, Vermont and Michigan are all in the bottom ten states in GDP per capita, Vermont is the least-religious state according to Pew, Maine is the fourth-least-religious, and Michigan is below-average. One such paper,[ by Philipp Ager and Antonio Ciccone in 2018,] argues that a third of the difference in religiosity between U.S. counties is explained by rainfall patterns, and theorizes that this is because people became more religious where they would need each other\u2019s help to survive acts of God such as droughts. A similar theory, [by Martin Fiszbein, Yeonha Jung and Dietrich Vollrath in 2023,] argues that the labor intensity of the different crops grown in different parts of the country (wheat had especially low labor intensity in 1900, and cotton and tobacco especially high labor intensity) led to higher conformity, lower individualism, and less education in areas that needed more people working in the fields. They claim that this is also borne out by changes in agricultural labor intensity caused by the mechanization of agriculture during the industrial revolution, and by the boll weevil epidemic in the early 20th century. But another confounding factor is that, as any student of American history knows, cotton and tobacco in the South were grown by enslaved Black workers on plantations. So, a more-charged causal explanation I\u2019ve also seen proposed is that the most religious counties in America were the ones most dependent on slavery, and it was slavery itself (rather than the high labor intensity that accompanied it) that caused religious fundamentalism to be popular. By this theory, people in the South turned to Biblical literalism because it provided the justification for slavery that they were desperately looking for. But these same areas also have large Black populations and were economically held back by widespread racial segregation for a long time. There are too many correlations to definitively point to one causative factor."

      "output": [
        "Cluster B personality disorders are characterized by significant, and often extreme, social/interpersonal impairment. People with these disorders are often very challenging to have a relationship with, and are prone to engaging in behavior that can end up hurting others. This explains a large amount of the stigma, since many people end up having negative experiences with individuals who have Cluster B disorders.",
        "In addition to the interpersonal behaviors other commenters described, these disorders are widely referred to as \"treatment resistant\". This includes both therapy and medication management options. While the term is statistically accurate, it certainly comes with a connotation. The stigma is under the umbrella of stigma around mental health issues in general, which I bring up due to your last question. Unfortunately, the stigma is widespread, and the reasons vary significantly (for example, misinformation, some people believe its a big pharma conspiracy, some people see it as \"weakness\", etc.). As a result, reduction is going to be difficult and would need to address more than one reason for the stigma. Reducing stigma on college campuses has been successful, to a degree. But we would have to have many more resources dedicated to the goal of stigma reduction to achieve significant change.",
        "Because the behaviors that are associated with cluster B personality disorders tend to be specifically harmful to others, particularly with ASPD and NPD. Take ASPD for example, as in the definition by the NIH: \"Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a deeply ingrained and rigid dysfunctional thought process that focuses on social irresponsibility with exploitive, delinquent, and criminal behavior with no remorse. Disregard for and the violation of others' rights are common manifestations of this personality disorder, which displays symptoms that include failure to conform to the law, inability to sustain consistent employment, deception, manipulation for personal gain, and incapacity to form stable relationships.\" While it is important that people with ASPD are not stigmatized for underlying conditions or emotional regulation concerns, the behaviors above that characterize ASPD should not be normalized. Unfortunately, that sort of separation of behavior and underlying personal struggle is not something that happens as often as we would like.",
        "1. Due to the nature of the disorders, people have very negative experiences with those diagnosed. Including clinicians, but often everyone around them. They have value as people, but there's often a lot of damage in their wake (and more coming) which is hard to compartmentalize. 2. They're... difficult... to treat, with *difficult* being such an understatement it approaches disingenuousness. There are treatments for say, BPD, but in their long form require such a time commitment from the therapist they aren't realistic, so clinicians (and those around them) have to white-knuckle it and do what they can hoping they're in the percentage that mellows as they age.",
        "the reason why cluster B personality disorders are so stigmatized is because people are usually speaking as victims of the abuse generally speaking, individuals with cluster B personality disorder are unpredictable and/or unstable; deceptive; disobey the law and/or interpersonal relationships and boundaries and do not make individuals feel emotionally and physically safe or secure around them if these individuals obeyed the law and social code and maintained equilibrium within themselves in relation to their external environment and were required by law to hold themselves accountable then they wouldn't be so feared or shunned by society whereas - on the other hand - people with anxiety disorders are not treated the same because they don't harm people yet they are frowned upon because a lot of people don't understand what the big deal is unless they experience it or know someone very close to them that has struggled with it at some point the only way that destigmatization will occur is by 1) creating visibility (as always) and 2) creating consequences for individuals that have these disorders so that if they violate, harm, or abuse someone then they experience a punitive cost however, the likelihood of that happening is slim-to-none because people with cluster B disorders rarely if ever seek professional help unless they are required to by greater authority and even people in positions of authority tend to fear them when identified and unmasked"

There are probably many factors contributing to this: he was a psychoanalyst and rhetorical trends tend to dismiss that tradition as \"pseudoscience,\" Fanon's major works we're in critical theory and not in quantitative experimentation, Fanon was a major critic of the hegemonic aspects of the psy-sciences and that is often responded to defensively, and Fanon was a literal enemy of the state against the Euro and Anglo colonial powers and most psychology textbooks aren't equipped to engage with those politics. Fanon is more likely to be discussed in ethnic studies, political theory, and philosophy courses. He's one of my favorite authors in human history and I wish psychology programs covered his work more in research ethics courses.",
        "I did a triple major undergrad course where I studied both English Literature and Psychology as majors. Fanon was only discussed in English Lit under critical theory and postcolonialism, and never once showed up in Psychology. Although our Lit teachers encouraged us to draw parallels between his work and what we studied as part of our Psychology curriculum. I agree with the other commentator who said that most Psychology textbooks aren't equipped to speak on the political aspect built from Fanon's work, making it hard to introduce him in mainstream Psychology courses. Freud showed up everywhere because theories could easily be distanced from all other aspects."

      "output": [
        "Supporting Ukraine wasn\u2019t an historically a divisive topic in the United States until recently. As recent as four months ago [63% of Americans] supported aid to Ukraine. Support among Democrats has remained relatively stable, while support among independent has dipped slightly and among Republicans significantly. Additionally it seems to be [mostly Republicans who believe Ukraine has received too much aid.] The partisan divergence regarding support for Ukraine while the country as a whole has remained relatively stable in its support indicates the issue has become politicized. Thus, a more proper question is how did aid to Ukraine become politicized, and specifically among the Republican Party. As most things that have to do with the Republican Party in the United States today, the answer is Trump. Historically the GOP are considered military hawks whom would normally support military aid to Ukraine wholeheartedly. However, Trump, his ideas, rhetoric, and politics have significantly altered those of the GOP. With the introduction of Trump to the GOP he has injected a growing affinity for isolationism, whereas the US since WWII has been heavily involved in world affairs as a competitor for hegemony during the Cold War and the sole hegemon after. Nonetheless, there are still many GOP politicians who believe in a world order led by the United States and view the US as a bulwark against anti-liberal, anti-democratic governments and actions across the globe. This rhetorical transition from involved superpower to isolationism is playing out in the Republican Party- but not everywhere. Many GOP politicians who want to stop aide to Ukraine still want aid for Israel and Taiwan. Consequently, their arguments for isolationism toward Ukraine specifically are not in good faith and clearly situational. So what\u2019s the situation with Ukraine? To understand how Ukraine is different it is imperative to understand the stranglehold that Trump has on GOP politics. Since his presidency, many GOP politicians have taken stances aligned with his rhetoric that were historically out of line with their own and this continues today in various forms. How Trump thinks and feels is often what becomes the policy position of the GOP today, as opposed to a deliberative policy review. Quite literally, as a Republican politician today, to go against Trump is to risk political suicide. As such, the party becomes susceptible to the will and whims of a single man, whom often is driven by revenge and resentment, which brings us to Ukraine. During the 2020 election Trump had attempted to initiate a quid pro quo with Ukraine where they would investigate his main political rival, Joe Biden, in exchange for receiving funding already allocated by Congress. Ukraine and Zelensky, however, balked, and the attempted scheme never materialized. The basis for the scheme to investigate Joe Biden was little more than a half-baked conspiracy. When the Democrats in Congress caught wind of this attempted corrupt quid pro quo they initiated impeachment proceedings and eventually impeached Trump. Trump himself was upset that Ukraine didn\u2019t play ball, and since the impeachment effort has disparaged Ukraine and publicly stated his lack of support for the ongoing military effort. Given his role in the GOP where his own personal beliefs and interests become party policy, many Republican politicians have followed suit, as have Trumps supporters and GOP voters (noting Trumps supporters are often the far right of the GOP voters, and today most GOP voters are Trump supporters). In the years since that failed quid pro quo and impeachment effort, and the formal Russian invasion of Ukraine, many voters and Americans have forgotten this incident, but Trump hasn\u2019t. He still remains spurned and embittered specifically towards Zelensky and Ukraine and wants revenge, and thus, so do his voters and underling Republicans. Today, much of the Ukraine rhetoric is masked under the guise of isolationism- but as I mentioned earlier is a bad faith argument since those making that arguments aren\u2019t wholly isolationist, just towards Ukraine. In the end, the old GOP establishment who want to uphold the US as the world hegemon, protectorate of the post-WWII and post Cold War world order, and defender of liberal democracy are at odds with Trump and his supporters who want both revenge on Ukraine and the US to selectively pull back its involvement from certain aspects of global geo-politics. Given most of the GOP voters today are in fact Trump supporters, support for Ukraine among the GOP has diminished significantly. TL;DR: Trump wants revenge on Ukraine for not going along with his quid pro quo to investigate Joe Biden and those intentions are being masked by bad-faith isolationist arguments that simultaneously co-opt Americans who are already of an isolationist mindset. Given the majority of the current GOP electorate are Trump supporters that support anything Trump says and does, they too no longer support Ukraine, though via arguments of isolationism as opposed to revenge for refusing the quid pro quo (though there are certainly GOP voters who are upset about that as well and want revenge just the same as Trump does).",
        "There are two separate issues combining to make this the case. The first is plain oppositional politics. [The US is very polarized right now,] so whatever one party is for, the other party tries to be against. The other is that Trump, the presumed Republican nominee and leader of the party, has [praised Putin] and has a particular disdain for Zelenskyy, who refused to grant Trump's [request to announce a public investigation into the son of Trump's political rival.] This led to [Trump's first impeachment.] So, in truth, it actually has a lot more to do with internal US politics than it actually does with Ukraine.",
        "Do you recall, before the war started, the big deal about Hunter Biden, his dad, gas and oil, and Ukraine? Ukraine is a corrupt country, and if you were an American company trying to do business there, you had better set aside money for bribes, because you were going to get nowhere without it. Politicians in bed with oligarchs to the detriment of their own people. This is a hard, cold fact of life and you can't deny it. If you are in the Tucker Carlson school of thought, the war is between two very corrupt countries and we should stay out of it. If Ukraine \"wins\", meaning Russia stops pursuing the war, Ukraine will go back to its corrupt state, and NATO will not except their application for membership anyways. Keep in mind that the process to become a NATO member is not easy, not done because one of our Presidents wants it. The applicant country has to prove it has truly embraced democracy and all the member countries have to agree. To that end, Ukraine doesn't have a hope in Hell of gaining membership. If it did, it would have been a member long ago, like in the mid 90s, and Russia would not have dared attack it. However (there is always a However), it's not as if the United States or NATO hasn't supported other less than desirable countries in the past. We pick and choose. There is also something insidious going on here. Prior to the invasion, we were looking upon Russia as a real threat, like they were 10 feet tall and full of muscle. Now we see that their military is incompetent, badly lead, unmotivated, badly supplied. Their tanks, which were supposed to be so special and modern, have been destroyed with great regularity. Russia is burning itself out with this war, and the more it does so, the less it will have for anything else it wants to accomplish. And all we in NATO have to do is keep supplying Ukraine with our \"leftover\" weapons, and money of course. But don't look upon that is something that is all good. Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed, millions displaced. If the war stopped today, Ukraine will still have a tough time coming back. Millions more have left the country and don't intend to return. The country had a low birthrate prior to the war and it has gotten even lower still because of it. Depopulation of Ukraine is a real thing, whether it wins or not. Last point. You might recall that a year ago a pipeline from Russia to western Europe was destroyed. Biden blames Putin for it. Does that make sense to you? If Putin wanted to use the pipeline as leverage with the Germans for instance, all he had to do was turn it off, not destroy it. But if you were Biden and you wanted to make sure that Germany could not buy Russian natural gas and put money in Putin's pocket? Yes, sending a submarine to do that dirty work makes sense. Germany is now importing its natural gas using tankers, and it is costing them. So to answer your question, the divisive points are corruption, the end of Ukraine, us using them to weaken Russia at the cost of Ukrainian lives."

        "I'll give it a shot. I'd say there are two basic reasons. The first is adversarial. Capitalism is a system that's easy to get into and hard to get out of, because the system creates a class of people who have a vested interest in keeping it going. And aside from the 1%, there's a huge group of people who are reactionaries... I think reactionary is a great word, much better than traditionalist or conservative, because it sums up the position perfectly: anything that produces positive change, they react against. Anything bad produced by capitalism, they react by blaming it on phantom enemies: Black \"welfare queens\", immigrants, Jewish, feminists, transgender people, etc. [Even when they're not economically insecure at all, this scapegoat mentality is still marketed to them and appealing to them]. The reactionary position has *huge* access to capital flows to reproduce their message and ideology. All major media and social media companies are, of course, on the side of capital, which means they're quasi-neutral politically, but will play any side or favor any political position that increases their bottom line on the balance sheet. The other reason comes down to various knowledge problems. Most people don't want to get involved in the stress and conflict of political life. They'd rather not think about it, or think about it only in small amounts. Leftists, in this environment, tend to be unusual because they want to participate *more*, and sometimes assume that everyone should care more like they care, and get angry and dispirited when they aren't. Older leftists are typically wiser about human behavior and know how to persuade a wide range of people. But because we have so much generational segregation in this country, every leftist generation kind of reproduces itself along the college/presidential four-year cycle, and a lot of the useful on-the-ground knowledge doesn't get transmitted between generations. Another knowledge problem is knowing who to trust as a leader. If you read Stalin's writings, some of them are quite relatable and compassionate. But when he came into power, he acted as an incompetent monster and killed millions. People lie all the time; people change all the time. This is a widely realized problem on the left and there's been a century of trying to work out solutions. One is to fine-tune hierarchical systems that check and weed out potential Stalins. Another (that anarchists subscribe to) is to build systems from the ground up that aren't hierarchical at all. Both of these approaches are difficult to implement and limit the spread of leftist ideas, in contrast with reactionary ideas, which are dead simple and have no ethical dimension at all. But at least there are plenty of leftists *trying*, and getting things done in the meantime. And finally, there are some groups out there\u2014radical orthodox MLs/MLMs\u2014who refuse to admit the problem exists at all, Stalin was a great guy, all those other leftists are nasty and have liberal cooties, etc., and they form little culty groups who hand out newspapers at protests until they fall apart when the male leader gets a horrific sex abuse publicized. Young leftists who encounter these groups get burned out of leftism pretty quick. It turns into a depressing situation where the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity.",
        "Hi, I'm late to the party but let me give this a shot from an anarchist perspective. Hierarchy is a system where people are ranked above or below each other in terms of status and authority. In a capitalist society control over resources is the basis of these different levels of status. Once you control some resources it becomes easier to gain control over other resources. If you own a a large business you can buy more businesses, especially ones that compete with you. Ownership of resources becomes concentrated in the hands of a few. A meritocracy is the idea that people gain status bases on their merit. The most skilled and knowledgeable workers get the best paying jobs. The idea of meritocracy breaks down because developing skill and ability requires an investment of resources in someone at a young age. The offspring of those high in status will have better training, education nutrition, environment, and other factors. Often these gaps begin as early as prenatal care. So you end up with a system that is closer to a high tech Feudalism with aristocratic owners being aided by a minority of high status helpers who pass that status down to their kids via an illusionary meritocracy. Communism/socialism tries to change this by removing the private ownership of resources. Instead resources are owned by the government and given out to people as needed.\u00a0 But who gets to determine where those resources are needed? A government leader of some kind. These government leaders now have the highest status and can give those resources to themselves. Both systems will use an armed guard group to protect their resources. These guards can use violence to get the job done. These guards are typically loyal to the people who control the resources. In many capitalist countries the rich people don't officially control the guards but they clearly have a very different relationship with them than lower status people. The ownership class will struggle against each other to control more resources but they usually can't call on the armed guards to eliminate their rivals, at least not if those rivals have the same level of status. In a communist country to armed guards and the resources are all controlled by the same people. People with the highest status absolutely can call on the armed guards to eliminate their rivals. Thus, power begins to be based on who has the most control over the armed guards. This can turn into a situation where the people in\u00a0charge maintain control solely through violence. Immoral violent people can take over a system from within quite quickly by killing their rivals, or well meaning government leaders can watch for such people and stop them before they take power. This is why communist countries often turn into dictatorships. Capitalist countries are less likely to turn into dictatorships because the owners at the top don't use violence against each other, only against people of much lower status. Instead they use the illusion of meritocracy to keep people loyal, letting people believe that anyone could rise to become one of the elite owner class even though that's incredibly difficult. Owners use money and influence to exert a mostly hidden control over a government that outwardly looks like a democracy. People get upset at the government leaders who are constantly changing instead of getting upset at the owners who control everything else. Because communism is younger than capitalism it is at a disadvantage. Capitalist countries outnumber communist countries by a wide margin and historically would not trade with communist countries. This meant that if a communist country was short on some resources, like if bad weather made them have less food to harvest, they couldn't easily trade for it. This meant that communist countries were much more vulnerable to these things and made it very difficult to recover. If a disease killed all their livestock they couldn't just trade for meat from somewhere else, they would just not have any meat. This changed when the US started trading with China. China is now very strong and stable because they have access to business partners all across the world. When Russian stopped being communist their leaders quickly turned into capitalists. The same people were in charge for the most part but now they are private owners. The people who were poor during the soviet era are now still poor, and in many cases are far more poor today.",
        "As an older U.S. democrat, a bit left of center, the issue for me is the need for competition. Fundamentally I believe in competition, and I don't understand how competition works in a communist or purely socialist system. Take universal health care. How do you drive prices competitively down, and research incentives up? If through government control, at best that's a recipe for corruption. So I guess I'm indoctrinated in the fundamentals of capitalism, though I believe capitalism must be balanced by socialistic systems like welfare, monopoly control, some base of guaranteed healthcare, guaranteed housing, and probably some level of UBI in the next 20 years, given excessive automation. In other words, the downside of capitalism is it's fundamentally unfair, and so must have a very strong safety net, and must be managed to maintain balance.",
        "1. First off don't conflate Socialism and Communism. They are not the same thing. 2. Which \"Socialist\" theory do you want to go with? The ancient greeks? The late medieval period? The Reformation? The Enlightenment? Or the Post-Industrial? Jewish Communities? Early Christian Communities? Point #2 is actually the rub here. People's perception of Socialism is only Post-Industrial because of the cold-war struggle between the US and USSR. In reality, socialism as a philosophy has existed for thousands of years, and to be honest...it isn't a \"failure\". Democracy has a grounding in socialism; \"for the common good\" ... \"for the common defense\" ... \"E Pluribus Unum\". The Enlightenment has a grounding in socialism; \"we are all equal\" ... \"we all have inalienable rights\". These are social-adjacent ideals, and thus also socialist-adjacent ideals. You can't have the Post-Industrial version of Socialism when there's monarchs. Why? Because the Monarchs own everything, not corporations. But the opposition to monarchs and the breaking of their monopoly on power *was socialist in nature*, even if not in name. Even capitalism's roots has an element of socialism to it. Trading ships were expensive, so a wealthy person likely has only enough money to build 1 or 2, and if one is lost in a storm...there goes your entire livelihood and assets. However; what if you could pool your money together with other people and have collective ownership of shares of an entire fleet? So when a single ship is lost we are all impacted, but not as badly as if it was the only ship we owned...and we all share in the profits of the successful voyage? That's a corporation stock-share concept that is really where capitalism's roots come from. What is that if not socialist in nature? You socialize the gains/losses amongst the shareholders. I'd personally argue that ***socialism*** is the ***most successful*** philosophy/ideology in history. It's just you have to focus on the understanding of the philosophy, not the Cold-War misrepresentation of it.",
        "I actually recommend you look at this from the opposite direction. What makes successful societies successful? I'd recommend you look into meritocracy: In general, you want citizens striving for competence. Rewarding that competence is an excellent way to keep society evolving. Societies that are more meritocratic are better equipped to invent technology and advance industry. That said, the more meritocratic a society becomes, the worse things get for disadvantaged populations. This is often where socialist and communist ideals start to look appealing, particularly to young people who have yet to establish themselves.",
        "Communism and socialism works on a small scale. Churches. Tribes. Communes. Once you get past the social circle limit, it breaks down. You can't really care about more than 200 people. Beyond that, you start excluding or not caring as much. You might open your home to a neighbor in need, but not really a drifter. There's also limited resources. How do you fairly distribute it? Who has makes it? Marx talks about a post-scarcity, fully autonomous world. In a world where there is no want and no need to work, communis/socialism can happen. We can see how that happens in Star Trek. Even there, plenty of places need more resources they can't have. Last, we have human nature. The main caveat when talking about true socialism/communism is if I was in charge. If I was in charge, then it would be beautiful because I'm altruistic. But, the guy behind me is not. And, now I'm dead. Many people aren't that altruistic. There would need to be a way to make sure that the leadership is good. That's hard. Almost impossible. The people who want power would abuse it. Then, as stated in other posts, we ignore the failed efforts of true socialism/communism because they failed. We look at the successes. Which aren't actually socialism. They are capitalist societies with strong social nets with a homogenous culture. They make a lot of money to support much of their social work. Their people are almost all the same, so they all mostly agree and there's no \"other\" to deal with."

        "This is a good observation and a great question. Unfortunately, like all great questions I don't think there is a singular answer. Academics will likely be unpacking this for a long time. One factor is certainly the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 and the fallout from that. This put additional financial strain on working class and poor people around the world. This paired with automation, offshoring, and decades of austerity policy in advanced capitalist countries has resulted in pretty dismal prospects for the middle and lower classes in those countries. The signs of unrest were evident in things like the occupy movement. Conditions like this are perfect for populist politicians who claim to be 'anti-establishment' and for 'working families' to rise to power using rhetoric that often involves scapegoating. A convenient scapegoat has been \"wokeness\" and everything seen as progressive (reproductive rights, LGBT+ rights, racial justice, etc). This has been used successfully in all the places you mentioned. Progressive politics and policies is particularly ripe for scapegoating because they seek to remedy existing arbitrary power imbalances. So if you have a poor working class man whose economic prospects have been (unjustly) whittled down to nothing it can be relatively easy to convince them it's because of feminism, which is trying to (justly) remove arbitrary privilege based on gender. Another factor is the failure to regulate social media. Platforms are designed to service the attention economy - to keep people engaged for as long as possible to serve them as many ads as possible. It turns out, fear and outrage are good ways to keep people's attention so you have algorithms serving them that content, pushing conspiracy theories, and widening social divides. [Journalists] and academics have noted this tends to create an alt-right pipeline. Add to this the fact that governments around the world using [troll farms] to interfere in other countries' political matters by sowing divisiveness, and you can start to see a perfect storm brewing. I know this last bit sounds dodgy, but these types of operations are well documented.",
        "According to some theories, the capital class will do whatever it can to remain in power. While most of it usually prefer to placate the working class with social democratic reforms, this may not always be achievable. If it feels threatened by popular revolts, it will support fascism to subvert and suppress it. According to Marx, capitalism needs to grow, and increase exploitation, inevitably increasing class conflict. Bertold Brecht in 1935 therefore wrote a paper called, *\"Fascism is the True Face of Capitalism\"* Both capitalism and fascism promote patriarchy, racism, exacerbating misery for its lowest subjects, imperialism, submission to authority, individualism etc. That is how the one can slide into the other so quickly and gain such support. Continuing from a perspective which tries to discern the material interests of one group of people, from those of another, based on their place in the social hierarchy, the US 'progressive' party and the 'conservative' party both represent the interests of the ruling class. The former absorbs and defangs popular movements from its left, and presents as the 'more humane' face of Empire. The trick is to split people along lines other than that between the rulers and the ruled. A more traditional and coherent definition of left/right, is those who seek less hierarchy, vs those who want more of it. When looking at it that way, it's not clear that 'progressives' are much further to the left than 'conservatives'. Under Obama, the US war machine extended its destruction abroad with drones and more bombs, increased incarceration and so on. From the perspective of a system for domination, when pressed, it makes sense to yield only to those demands that do not affect class relations, while at the same time outraging socially conservative authoritarians. Such examples would be: A dark skinned ruler, female bosses, queer rights, etc. 'why now?' Continued repression of anti-authoritarian social movements, increasingly exploitative workplaces and economic inequality, monopolized propaganda, looming apocalypse, and increasingly individualistic, authoritarian 'anti-social programming' due to failures of western childcare (ie the nuclear family model and the school systems).

        "Something I've started wondering about recently is if one factor is a kind of \"virtual behavioral sink\". The concept of the behavioral sink came from a series of experiments performed on rats in the early 60s and published in Scientific American. In the experiment a population of rats was given finite space but unlimited food and water and the space was kept clean. Population grew very rapidly but then hit a point where the rats experienced a bizarre kind of social collapse that eventually led to the death of the entire population despite having all their material needs met. Calhoun theorized that there was some effect caused by the mere density of the population, that he called \"the behavioral sink\". Just this week it occurred to me that social animals might experience a behavioral sink if their \"social lives\" become dense enough regardless of physical density. Social media use means that people are having more interactions with other people and with more different people each day than ever before, by many orders of magnitude. What if this is driving a kind of behavioral sink effect in the human population?"

      "output": [
        "The fight or flight response is your body\u2019s involuntary, brief response to an *immediate* stressor, preparing you to take some extreme physical action to survive the moment. Increased heart rate and respiration to help get blood to your muscles, drastically slowed digestion because your body doesn\u2019t need to worry about digestion in this moment, and drastically decreased sex drive because sex isn\u2019t a concern when you\u2019re trying not to die. Conscious thoughts about the deep future or the past are nearly eliminated in that moment, because you don\u2019t want to be distracted by momentarily unnecessary higher reasoning. It\u2019s go-time. It\u2019s not really about fight OR flight. It\u2019s not about the choice or \u201cwhich one is most appropriate?\u201d. It\u2019s truly not that complex. It\u2019s your body shutting down certain processes that would inhibit your ability to save yourself\u2014 however that may be. It\u2019s an instinctual, involuntary response that is not contextual nor flexible. Meaning, your body is not actually deciding \u201coh I gotta prepare to run\u201d or \u201cI gotta prepare to fight for my life.\u201d Rather, it\u2019s a general \u201cI gotta prepare for *anything*.\u201d The response is equally as helpful in preparing you to run tf away or to fight for your life. It\u2019s an adrenaline rush. You ever hear stories like people lifting cars off babies in the heat of the moment? Their panicked body is not capable of deciding the exact processes necessary to lift a car. It\u2019s just given them the ability to act fast, think fast, and have no inhibition about using their muscles. I think that the name of it has caused confusion. People often think of it as \u201cfight OR flight\u201d like the difference between the two matters. It\u2019s not \u201cor\u201d as in \u201cPepsi or Coke?\u201d but rather, as in, \u201cis there a doctor or nurse on board?\u201d. The answer is not \u201cfight\u201d nor \u201cflight\u201d but rather, \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201cno emergency.\u201d",
        "\"fight or flight\" is the common name for the body's responses to an unsafe situation. Your autonomic nervous system (ANS) (think \"automatic\" functions) can be grouped into two major parts: the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Your PSNS involves hormones that aid digestion, shrink your pupils, slow your heartbeat and breathing, loosens your bowels, and reroute blood to certain areas of your brain that promote prosocial behavior. These nerve circuits relax your body after responding to danger. Your SNS can push your body to extremes, widening your pupils, pausing functions like digestion and defecation, moving more blood to your muscles, speeding up your heartbeat and breathing, raising your blood pressure, dulling your pain sense, etc. This allows you to respond to an immediate threat to your safety. \"fight or flight\" refers to when your SNS raises your levels of adrenaline, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, cortisol, and some other brain hormones, causing an automatic narrowing of your vision, increase in your heart rate, ringing in your ears, and readiness to move your body. This allows you to run away from a threat or fight it to keep yourself safe and alive. But the truth of how your body responds to stress is a little more complicated and driven by habit, situation, and experience. Some people also \"freeze\" when their SNS is activated. This is actually a few separate behaviors that are slightly different. One is called \"pointing,\" where your focus narrows on a sound or sight that may be a threat to determine what the threat is, how large it is. This is an active freezing that comes before other responses. The SNS is still dominant here. For some people, both the SNS and the PSNS are active at the same time, and the PSNS can even be dominant. You can see their heart rate lower, their breathing stops, they can't talk, and they don't run or fight. They freeze and hope the threat passes. This is evident in rats and other mammals as well as humans, and the response depends on whether the threat is close or distant, whether there are clear escape routes, a person's relationship to the threat, whether they have a history of anxiety, whether they believe fighting/running will be successful, and whether they have been through this trauma before. Whatever strategy they choose, if it is unsuccessful and they begin to be attacked, some will enter \"tonic immobility,\" or playing dead. The body can be in all kinds of states when playing dead, as the threat is very active and ongoing and the ability to beat the threat has been let go. It is hard to study as it is unethical to subject an animal to active trauma to trigger tonic immobility. This can technically be broken up into a few specific responses, but this is the blank-eyed, waiting-for-the-end, vacant trauma response. There is another response to stress, sometimes called the \"fawn\" response, that is more complicated. Often people who have this type of response are victims of long-term relational trauma at the hands of a domestic partner or caregiver. This suffering has historically been ignored---see Judith Herman's book Trauma and Recovery for a more detailed history---and this term for the response was only coined in 2013 by Pete Walker to discuss behaviors seen in complex PTSD (a disorder as yet unlisted in the DSM). Fawning seeks to prevent abuse by agreeing with / placating the abuser by forfeiting their rights, needs, preferences and boundaries. It has largely not been studied neurochemically so the mechanisms behind it are unclear, but it seems to be a parasympathetic response that aims to soothe the attacker when an imminent attack is expected, and becomes a common course of action other options to escape/overcome the attacker have historically failed. One final reaction to trauma / immediate danger is similar to freezing, but has been called the \"flop\" response because conscious control over the muscles shuts down. Your body becomes loose and goes floppy, sometimes including blackout, loss of control over bodily functions, and disorientation. All of these responses are meant to protect the victim from an attack and minimize the damage, and none are more or less valid as responses than any other. The body is extremely good at trying to survive harrowing situations, and has a large toolkit of ways to do that. Sometimes, the body gets stuck in some of those responses, but it's important to remember that all of these responses are functional reactions to an extremely dangerous situation."

They more often than not go hand in hand, but in your example the oppressed spouse is using drugs to change her emotional state to one which is \"in defiance of\" her circumstances. At the same time it's worth pointing out that for many people who are being abusively physically controlled it can be hard to impossible to gain access to drugs, even sadly legal ones as denial of mental/physical healthcare is extremely common in controlling/abuse situations."

        "This question has been asked and answered a lot of times on reddit (among other places) here's a google result from u/darzin_ The short answer is that these ideas were represented in the 60s by a small but loud minority and didn\u2019t become less popular but rather became less visible during the times you mentioned. Our popular image of the 60s is of hippies, Vietnam war protests, free love and general societal upheaval, however, this only every constituted a minority of people. Gallup polls found that as of 1967 only 1% of Americans had been to an anti-war protest, and only 9% would consider going to one. In a university of Michigan study asking about social groups in America fully a third of people gave war protestors the lowest possible rating and only 16% gave them any sort of positive rating. Regarding hippies A sociologist Lewis Lablonsky who attempted to analyze hippies as a subculture concluded that as of 1968 there were only 200,000 dedicated hippies in the US. This doubtless undercounted as he didn't count teenagers or people who may be hippie adjacent (for example 400,000 people attended Woodstock). And it's very hard to quantify a subculture with no hard boundaries but we can still see that hippies were not the norm for this period, and that the \u201cpopular image\u201d of the 60s was confined to a rather small minority of people. The popular mythos of the 60s is enduring everyone went to Woodstock, protested the war, smoked some pot and then grew up and put on a tie and went to work for the man in Nixon\u2019s/Reagan\u2019s America. These are almost a founding story of modern American society, but like so many founding myths it\u2019s not really true and an idealized version of the past. And the numbers don\u2019t bear it out there really was a silent majority that was scandalized by the counter culture rising in backlash to it. The counterculture really was a counter culture outside mainstream, even at it\u2019s height. The ideas of the counterculture were also not really \u201cdefeated\u201d in the 70s and 80s rather they were organized and scattered into to many different movements and subcultures we can trace to the 60s everything from New Age Spiritual movements, to the gay rights movement had their origin there, Nixon\u2019s silent majority was a reaction to these, and Falwell\u2019s later moral majority the same, though by that time these ideas were no longer counter culture but part of the fabric of American society. The hippie was no longer shocking but rather a character from central casting. Despite it\u2019s very real cultural power; the Moral Majority/American reaction/Evangelical Fundamentalism, also has a somewhat mythical reputation, and never achieved the dominance that it sought being able to influence the political and religious spheres, but failing to gain ground in the cultural and academic spheres except among it\u2019s own parallel institutions. Almost from it\u2019s inception it was subject to relentless pushback and mockery. And it by no means had a lock on 80s culture as seen by the rise and popularity of music genres like Metal and laugh lines in shows like the Simpsons. While movments so such as the gay rights movement formalized and grew. While the pop narrative is a fun one, we can see that counter culture/progressive ideas were not mainstream in the 60s and the religious right/traditional America was having trouble even at it\u2019s height. These ideas have less ebbed and lowed than gradually shifted in one direction. John Mueller, War, Presidents and Public Opinion (New York: Wiley, 1973), chs. 26.

Anecdata of Boomers is always already skewed because it's based on an unrepresentative sample of those Boomers who are still alive and exist within the observers' current social circle. This is a good article that explains why: [\"Poor people die younger in the U.S. That skews American politics.\"] It draws on this peer reviewed study: . I've also noticed that people don't see other people as \"Boomers\" unless they already fit a certain profile. For example, houseless people are never called Boomers, even though an increasing number of them are in their seventies.

        "[COINTELPRO has a big impact] . This is a great wikipedia article with a lot of important links. In the late 40s, the Smith-Mundt Act passed and it prohibited the Pentagon from peddling overt propaganda aimed at its own citizens. With no major war effort to fight, many of the folks working in the Propaganda departments went to the private sector. Worked with advertising. Helped build think tanks. A lot of these folks had a very 'Particular' idea of what it meant to be an American, and were very good at painting who exactly gets to be included and excluded in that. One solution to the domestic propaganda ban was [Operation Mockingbird] So much of those programs have been studied, refined and redeployed in new ways from different attack vectors. These are the tools of the billionaire class. Just look at the degree that, for example, banks worked with intelligence agencies and law enforcement to break Occupy Wallstreet. Reagan fucked so many parts of America over (Union busted, destroyed 3rd spaces that were used to foment the civil rights battles, created an unholy alliance between big capital and christianity with their prosperity gospel, deregulated, and so on as per the [Starve The Beast] strategy of undermining the federal government programs that advocated and benefited the vast majority of us) The true effects weren't as deeply felt in the 90s because of the Tech boom. But thats when the rot started to spread - the middle class never recovered in meaningful ways. Clinton and Biden in the early 90s helped found the Third Way democrats. Which were corporate-focused instead of people focused. Gone are the days of social safety nets - fall and suffer. As they allowed government programs to die that helped Americans, they were responsible for the laws which led to **a new prison being built in America every 10 days between 1990 and 2005.** 3 strike laws plus racist policing led to a lot of broken homes. When 9/11 happened, every single media pundit reacted to every minor criticism of America's downward trajectory for the majority of americans as... Unamerican! Do you want the taliban to win? For the next 8ish years, a vast majority of valid critiques of America was met with outrage. The most influential \"progressive\" media that was tolerated was Jon Stewart (a deeply centrist man who focused on pointing out how silly, internally inconsistent and goofy conservative media was). This was met with market cycles of major booms and busts, as the regulating body of the US was mostly vitiated. Cloture and filibuster changes made it so a simple majority was no longer sufficient to pass legislation. Leading to a [minority doom loop] \\- where a small number of voters can entirely shut down the government. Which keeps happening. Now a lot of boomers are on the receiving end of their terrible decisions. But they are being constantly fed the story of other folks who are to blame. This is an extremely well documented tactic for getting poor people to infight and leave the rich to profit. Right wing media is now a total information cocoon. Expertise is given the same air time as uninformed blowhards. It does not take very long for radicalization to arise when opposing views aren't heard, and the overton window keeps getting pushed. Conservative boomers have every reason to be scared and angry. The great country they inherited is gone and their lives are precariously balanced. Due to their choices - not the boogeyman. And they lack the resources and thoughtfulness to do anything but double down - such that a mentally diminished incontinent rapist with 91 current indictments, who literally doesn't believe in exercise, andlives in a literal golden tower in NYC, is their overwhelming pick.",

        "Okay, let's step back from empirical evidence for just a second. Philosophy helps us hear. Simone de Beauvoir's [The Ethics of Ambiguity ] has something tangential to say on this subject. The existentialists were generally all in agreement that as humans, we are free. de Beauvoir calls it the drama of original choice. Every choice is it's own choice, it's a choice we make. These ideas are crucial to social science because social sciences are trying to get at the empirical evidence of what humans do. The existentialists posited that we are free and that is the human condition. de Beauvoir lays out an argument in the source cited. Okay, so what does this have to do with racists and their choices? Well, de Beauvoir makes a little critique of marxists in the text cited. She argues that given human freedom, Marxist are wrong to accuse the bourgeoisie of being unable to choose against their own interests or that they are destined to choose the capitalist system always. The critiques she uses in this example, I believe, extend to all other domains of social identity. No person is destined to act a certain way even by the constraints of their social identity. At least that's a theory...so what's the evidence? Now, historically we have examples of racist organizing directly hurting white people. It's a \"if this group I hate will have it, then I don't want anyone to have it\" kind of thing. See [The Sum of Us] for a book about theses examples of when white Americans, in order to hurt minorities or maintain racism, directly injured their own civic arena. Humans are complex. Even white racists are! For example, white racist women might have an idea of why the would benefit from racist organizing...but what about their gender? Racist men are usually very traditional in their sense of gender roles, so why do some white women join them in organizing? Well, it's not a simple negotiation that these women make but it is one that [sociologists ] have tried to understand. It's not simple. And I would say that is the take home message. It's not as simple as \"white people uphold racism because racism benefits them.\" Every word in that sentence can be broken down to complicate the picture.

        "These are three words that were developed separately from one another, not three ideas that were part of the same experiential structure. What that means is that, as constructs, they aren't necessarily comprehensive or categorically different. They don't cover every possible kind of way of thinking about oneself and there could be crossover in the actual things that the words refer to. Youre thinking like they're three different parts of the same theory when actually they are three different theories. As technical terms, they first two are well defined, though. Self esteem is a moral and emotional judgment of the self. It's how much you like yourself/value yourself. Self efficacy by contrast is how much you believe in yourself or feel in control of your situation. Though obviously you're more confident in situations where you have expertise, it is also often used in a general way to describe how much you feel like an effective person overall. So what's the difference between that and self confidence? Not much. As a shade of meaning, self confidence is rarely used to mean domain-specific confidence, so it usually means trust in yourself generally but as those authors cited by the wiki article point out, people who are studying self confidence are probably studying either the same or mostly the same thing as people studying self efficacy."

        "I\u2019m not sure of particular studies specifically examining how this phenomenon came about, perhaps because it seems so self-evident, but there are works going back decades acknowledging this dynamic, previously referred to as the Eastern Establishment or just the East Coast, referring to old money in major cities like NYC, Philly, and Boston, as well as those affiliated with institutional powerhouses like Wall Street and the Ivy Leagues. It\u2019s also worth noting this originally wasn\u2019t about Dems vs Repubs (remember not so long ago in historical terms the Southeast was a Democratic stronghold, prior to the political reorganization of the US in response to Republican adoption of the \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d) but a split in the Republican Party. See, eg: The Eastern Establishment and the Western Experience, originally published in 1968. As money and power shifted to the West Coast as well (Hollywood, Silicon Valley, new West Coast urban centers, etc) language shifted. Of course, this language conveniently doesn\u2019t acknowledge money and power has also drifted significantly Southward, for example, alongside the fact that the political leaders set in supposed opposition to the \u201celite\u201d are generally by definition the elite themselves: Reagan and arguably even moreso the Bushes and Trump are thoroughly part of this \u201celite\u201d. It also erases the extent to which \u201cestablishment/elite\u201d states include significant rural and/or working class populations struggling due to things like the development of the Rust Belt and corporatization of agriculture. Arguably a more generalized and localized version of this is reproduced through discussion of the \u201curban elite\u201d - which again has some truth to it while erasing struggles of many urban populations (often minorities and immigrants) and ignoring that the politicians egging these resentments on are more often than not elites themselves. This suggests the dynamic at least in recent decades is more about evoking symbolic alliances/ oppositions as much or more than about geographical or economic realities. Intertwined in all this are arguably threads of anti-intellectualism, racism, and xenophobia, and complex rural-urban tensions, while also including threads of valid economic critique and power inequity."

It's not harmful in itself, but it can be pretty scary for you and people around you, and it's indicative of something deeper that needs to be addressed. If you have the means, I'd recommend seeing a psychologist in person, preferably one who has training and experience in treating trauma.

        "From a psychiatry perspective, I don\u2019t particularly like CPTSD as a diagnosis. Firstly, because I think it is often attributed to people with a borderline diagnosis in an effort to be less stigmatising. This is all well and good except that the stigma will just migrate to the new label, especially if we leave this as untreated as it currently is. Secondly, and most importantly, I think that deriving from from PTSD is the wrong lineage to capture the clinical phenomena that it\u2019s trying to describe. PTSD typically stems from trauma sustained in adulthood, and originally war trauma, I.e. \u201cshell shock\u201d and the like. What is so prevalent in current culture is developmental trauma, which is quite a different beast. This can manifest as a wide range of clinical phenomena, including PD, ASD, ADHD, psychosis and anxiety and depression. See Bruce Perry\u2019s neurosequential model. There will often be various patterns of disordered attachment also. Another thing to bear in mind is that the DSM is bullshit. I apologise for the unscientific terminology but in psychiatry we tend to conflate diseases for symptoms, and for aetiologies and vice versa, and this leads to a huge amount of confusion. For example, is depression an \u201cendogenous\u201d disease? Or a symptom cluster stemming from an understandable adaptation to the present circumstances? Or a manifestation of childhood trauma? It could be either, but by DSM criteria it\u2019s all the same. You have to actually talk to the patient for more than 10 mins to find out. Always remember that psychiatry is at the \u201cnaturalist\u201d stage of biology. Classifying and describing phenomena. We are yet to reach the stage of an underlying principle or mechanical understanding of mental distress, a la current biology with the theory of evolution and molecular underpinnings. Therefore everything must be taken with a pinch of salt.",

It's certainly a still far from fixed diagnosis, but the rather enthusiastic reception of the general concept of C-PTSD by online self-help communities shows, clearly enough, that patients find it useful and reflecting their experiences well. Being a bit fuzzy around the fringes might even be helpful here, since overly narrow taxonomy only leads to the inevitable introduction of catch-all attempts like DESNOS and EPCACE that tend to underwhelm from an aetiology perspective and do not meet validation and narrative needs of patients. C-PTSD does, so that's certainly contributing to its popularity, especially outside the confines of academia, but it's also helpful in practice by providing a framework to sieve through self-reporting that's riddled with normalization of adverse circumstances. Given the ongoing development, I'll resort to metaphor in order to describe the key distinction between PTSD and C-PTSD: one giant blow vs death by a thousand cuts. Long term exposure and its effects seem to be the one criterium that everybody agrees upon.",
        "This is purely my speculation but there is a raft of good evidence for \"cPTSD-like\" processes such as Adverse Childhood Experiences studies and whatnot - and an increase in research into ongoing trauma versus singular traumatic events the ICD seems pretty confident in their categorization of the disorder - its always difficult to assess how accepted something is across the board, I can tell you that NZs ACC (accident compensation corp) recognizes it as an official disorder which effectively means NZ accepts it"

Its name and association with intelligence are historical relics, I could give you your height in IQ scores. The practical implication is this: what an IQ score represents depends heavily on the specific test administered, as there are numerous IQ tests available, each measuring different constructs. Even within a single test, scores may reflect different attributes if certain test sections are omitted during administration, which can happen due to reasons like language barriers. As such, there is no uniform answer to your question. Interpreting an IQ score requires understanding which test was used, who took it, and against which sample it was normalized. While IQ scores are valuable for predicting various life outcomes and diagnosing clinical conditions, the specifics of these predictions and diagnoses hinge on the details of the test administration and normalization process. TLDR: People in popular discourse generally don't know what IQ is. It can measure different things based on context. It is useful to predict things and diagnose conditions.",

Fluid intelligence is how we process information and problem solve. \u2018Natural\u2019 intelligence? Fluid intelligence peaks at a certain point and slowly declines as we age. IQ tests aim to capture an individuals fluid intelligence/problem solving skills, however there are many different factors that impact the validity of an IQ test.

        "IQ tests were initially designed and used to separate the \"worthy\" from the \"unworthy\". Any evolution in the design or use of these tests has to grapple with this history first, or they will just continue to reinforce the same bullshit. \"Intelligence\" as a concept can describe too many things at once to be coherent. It's like the word \"problematic\", by itself it tells you almost nothing actionable. You can claim a star player has \"rugby intelligence\" to describe their ability to play rugby so well but what does that actually mean in the real world given there was once a time where rugby did not exist? Did the intelligence only come into existence alongside the game? Or did this particular pattern of innate traits just happen lend itself to the demands of this particular game but that person would have demonstrated equal \"intelligence\" if they'd pursued ballroom dancing, martial arts, flying a plane? So far it seems IQ tests measure IQ test intelligence. So... what then? It almost means nothing. At the same time, claiming \"intelligence does not ever exist\" and that everyone exists as the same blank slate of potential collapses ability down to the direct outcome of mere hard work, asserting everyone can have access to elite outcomes if they put in enough effort. Which is both cruel and untrue. Usain Bolt's classmates did not \"fail to practice running\" enough to keep up with him. There was another (uncontrolled and random) factor to his success beyond time and energy. Acknowledging that difference is only fair, both to him and everyone else. As is acknowledging the vast array of intelligences that result in outcomes that aren't socially prestigious or even noticed. There's no centralised Olympics of parenting, or suitcase packing, or idk, chimney sweeping. But my god are there champions out there who embody these patterns of intelligences, to no real applause. Imo the problem lies in assigning some bullshit moral value to one type of \"intelligence\" only, then using that as a bullshit proxy score to designate your \"worth\" in the bullshit social hierarchy. The bullshit just poisons its utility as a concept.

        "I'm no expert on this, but I can present a simple problem with IQ. Have you heard of the Flynn Effect? IQ scores rose every decade in the 20th century, at some points by 3 points per decade. According to Wikipedia, British children's IQs went up by 14 points from 1942 to 2008. This shows that the environment is a factor in a child's IQ. This is also perhaps the biggest problem with establishing racial differences in IQ. If we know that rising standards of living and education can cause IQs to go up by tens of points over the course of the 20th century, then it becomes reasonable that racial differences could shrink over time as well. In addition to the environment causing an actual boost in brainpower, it can also provide a boost to IQ scores without boosting intelligence itself. There was a study that found that Nigerians, when administered the same Raven's Progressive Matrices test twice, scored significantly better the second time around, because they were more familiar with the concept.",
        "My cognitive psychology lecturer used to say \"IQ tests test what IQ tests test\". He argued that you can buy a book that gives you the answers to the test and tells you how rach of the puzzles works and also pointed out that the tests are often culturally skewed. For example, if a question shoed an anagram of Mozart, that question is biased toward white, middle class Europeans. Someone from an Eastern country of a lower socio economic background might not answer it. Hr also gave lots of other examples of tests like math tests that are provided in schools around the world and hoe people of a country each is aimed at havr no problem answering them because they understand the context. Essentially, the argument is that IQ tests are typically bad at testing for intelligencr because IQ is supposed to be intrinsic, but all the questions test things that are learned. Someone who has been to school and had a good education will perform better on the test, so the test is actually testing things they learned rather than their intrinsic intelligence. So no, IQ tests aren't good. We struggle to define intelligence. The tests are biased. And they don't really do what they intend to do.",
        "From quite a lot of experience in taking and interpreting them my informal opinion is that they do definitely measure something - but it probably should not be called \"general intelligence\", which invokes a different idea. IQ measures an ability to solve technical puzzles, more or less. Before the mid 1990s, a programmer would be the highest IQ in the room. Programming was often done from scratch and you had to understand a lot of details about the mathematics and combinatorics. In that context - IQ was a very good measure of likely performance in programming. But, these days that is no longer true, and there is even a negative correlation between increased IQ and performance as a programmer. Also, once you hit a certain level of IQ, it is possible to fake your IQ performance by studying for the IQ test. Some people say that is not possible. But, I disagree - I have seen people study IQ tests and get a good score, even though their technical abilities are very bad. I knew a psychologist who said they could get any score they wanted on an IQ test - I believe them. I feel that IQ tests only really work if they are taken honestly. I won't attempt do define honest, but I hope the intention is clear."

Right now, for example, less emphasis is put on \"general IQ\" (although the scores still exist) and more is put on \"submetrics\" to give diagnosis. It is very important to say that IQ is just a tool. Seeing a number from someone is not the same as having a diagnosis for them; indeed, we should not be doing diagnostics with just an IQ number. At the very least, you always need to interview the patient, and you would usually do other tests in order to confirm your hypothesis. This is mostly controversial because of the cultural impact IQ has had. In academic settings, most people don't see IQ measurements as an all-encompassing thing that can tell you by itself how someone is doing.

Some psychologists believe that people inherit a \u201crange\u201d of intellect they have the capacity to fall into depending on environment, and that toxic stress, epigenetic factors, SES, and educational opportunities play a large role in determining where in that range a person will land as an adult. The vast majority of people are either close to average or below average in IQ, and people generally hate the idea of not being above average in a trait that is so prized and tied to human worth in Western culture, so there is a lot of defensiveness around the topic."

Cultural capital refers to things like musical knowledge and tastes, being able to talk easily about your experiences traveling around the world, knowing what attire is appropriate for what kinds of social events, having a particular diet and knowledge of food, having the right accent and the proper way of carrying your body, being able to discuss the proper literature. In order to be successful in elite spaces one needs elite social, economic and cultural capital. Elite families gift that to their children. Middle class parents gift middle class capital, and working class parents gift working class capital. So it is not that some people have cultural and social capital while others don't, it is that we all have different kinds of cultural capital that allow us to be successful in different social spaces. The elite keep non-elite people out of their circles by policing the boundaries of acceptable elite behavior. A good book on middle class versus working class cultural capital in American Child raising is [Annette Lareau's Unequal Childhoods]. She followed up on the families 10 years after the original study, and she discusses the findings in the most recent edition of the book. [Raj Chetty has also done some interesting work] on the factors that encourage and discourage economic mobility. He uses big data to illustrate patterns. If you go to the website you can explore the Research and the Data by clicking in the top menu. One of his most interesting findings is that the neighborhood you grow up in is more predictive of your future than your actual family is. So kids with with 2 parent families with full employment who live in under resourced neighborhoods don't do much better than kids with single parent and struggling families from those same neighborhoods. And if you can get kids out of under-resourced neighborhoods before age 8-11 or something you can change their entire life trajectory."

        "Two fundamental human needs are the need to belong, and the need to make meaning of the world. Studies of shown that belief in God can increase when a person feels a lack of meaning. It is also likely that people enjoy religion because it helps them fulfill their need to belong. another relevant psychological effect may be that when people around us say they believe something (even if it's obviously untrue), we are more likely to believe that thing, and more likely to actually perceive it that way. For example, there are studies that had two lines projected on a wall. Line a was obviously longer than line b. In the experiment there is one participant, and five confederates. The Confederates were all trained to say that they believed that line a was shorter than line b (Even though it obviously wasn't). Then the participant was asked which line they thought was longer. In this experimental condition, subjects were more likely to say that line a was shorter than line b. A Follow up study showed that even when this person was isolated afterwards, they continued to perceive the line a as shorter than line b (Even though it wasn't). Suggesting that the people around us can literally change our perceptions or beliefs. Another psychological effect that might be relevant are \"peak experiences.\" Some people have remarkable experiences of holistic beauty, meaning and bliss. These often have religious content. That is to say some people believe in god because they've had experiences that make them believe in God.",
        "The OP question can perhaps best be broken down into three slightly different subquestions: A. What makes (or historically made) people believe in the omnipresent omnipowerful interventionist God of the Abrahamic faiths? B. In more secular times why is organised religion still so popular? C. In more recent times, for those who are dissatisfied with organised religion what is the appeal of spirituality? From a psychological perspective I would suggest several known properties that might have historically led to (A). Firstly, humans are remarkably good at pattern recognition to the extent that we identity patterns even when they do not exist: [Apophenia] is the tendency for\u00a0perception\u00a0to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous\u00a0stimulus, so that one sees an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none. The visual version of this, [Pareidolia], is the most well known example. Clearly, this is an evolutionary beneficial strategy to avoid possible dangers in the environment even if most perceived threats are illusory. We seek to impose the structure of the familiar on the random even if that means we see animal shapes in background vegetation or faces in odd shaped rocks. The second human trait is [Theory of Mind (ToM)]. We recognise ourselves and others as having minds and agency. We attribute actions and intentions to others from early childhood. We wonder about and suspect the behaviour of others. If my food stash has disappeared and I didn't move it I will suspect someone or something else of having taken it. Putting these two together in early human history when mysterious life threatening events were not unusual might lead people to conclude that important events were not *actually* random and therefore some *unseen* powerful being (or beings) was responsible for these actions. In other words, \"god(s)\" were responsible for controlling the events. Add in some mythologising and soon you have a proto-religion. Give it more time and creativity and we evolve to early organised religions. What psychological need does this satisfy? Probably the same need that all thinking people (religious, atheists and scientists all) have: the need for a satisfactory understanding and explanation for the perceived reality of the observed universe, and an answer to questions such as what is the meaning of life and what happens after death? The religious model provides a very psychologically *comfortable* and *satisfactory* explanation (in the sense of providing certainty) to many. It provides an origin story. It explains why the world is seemingly so complex (biological life). It explains what you should do to lead a \"good\" life (morality). It even answers the important question of what happens after physical death. In contrast, to many religious people, the scientific model provides a very *uncomfortable* and *unsatisfactory* explanation, offering significantly less certainty. The origin story is very complicated (outside of physics) and currently not fully understood. The complexity story is also complicated and frequently misrepresented (evolution) and currently incomplete ([abiogenesis]. There is no fixed moral code, rather different moral codes are possible, these are flexible and can change over time. And the end story - no evidence for an afterlife - is kinda depressing and doubtless very unsettling to many. This choice of preferring to optimize [psychological comfort] over permanent scientific uncertainty can therefore be conceptualized as being a rational choice even if it is never overtly stated in such a way. For (B) the \"comfort and satisfaction\" explanatory components of organised religion are still present and important. In addition there are two other important psychosocial factors at play: [cultural bias] (individuals growing up with religion as part of their cultural identity) and [social compliance]. In a community of mainstream religious orthodoxy it is far easier to conform with the social norms no matter what one's internal beliefs truly are. From a research perspective it would be very interesting to fully understand to what extent religious followers currently believe more in the familiar cultural \"story\" provided by faith (because it provides psychological comfort) rather than any actual belief in god itself vs truly believing in an omnipresent omnipowerful god vs not really believing in either but being culturally embedded (and seeing no benefit to dissent and non-compliance from their familiar culture). For (C) there are many people who partly feel the same way that people from organized religion feel about science: that it provides an unsatisfactory or \"incomplete\" model of the perceived reality around them. That there must be something \"more\". Science does not provide them with psychological comfort. However, at the same time, some may not have a personal connection or belief in any particular god(s), or may feel alienated by their church's particular doctrinal orthodoxy, so they *also* feel dissatisfied with the narrative provided by traditional organised religions. They end up in the space of being labelled as \"spiritual\". This allows a much more free market pick-and-mix approach to beliefs to maximise personal satisfaction. For example, one common theme of [new age spirituality] seems to be the strong belief in an afterlife and at the same time the search for scientific validation of this.",
        "Depending on what variant of the supernatural we're talking about, there are also neurological reasons for it.  People predisposed to schizotypy, dissociation and/or (healthy) psychotic experiences will be more likely to report supernatural experiences, and follow a religion or spiritual path. You could argue that it helps people high in these traits organize their natural thinking style, as well as find an explanation for experiences that otherwise do not bother them.",
        "Basic Psychology? It is about preservation of self esteem. By not constantly questioning the meaning of reality, it allows people to go on with life more carefree, then religion gives people a behavioral framework, bounds to operate within. We are a conscious species that elevates from a hierarchy of needs. Once we\u2019re past the occupation of survival, eating, sleeping, basically not dying, we need motivation to continue and having a higher power to believe in gives us comfort to muddle through the mediocrity of life. As someone that was a strict materialist from the neurobiology perspective, knowing what I know about consciousness and the toolsets I\u2019ve learned from academia, at this later stage of life, I can honestly say now, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d And I\u2019m not alone, I\u2019m seeing many life long neuroscientists far more talented and esteemed than I, admitting as much in the eye of humility.",

        "Pretty much any statistical analysis by any body finds a sharp dropoff in most types of crime in the US after the early 90's[Here's just one example of homicide statistics] It's not just that tv shows and media attention in general is more freely given to killers from the 50's onwards. In the US rates of Violent crime, and indeed most other types of crime were rising sharply between the 1960's and the 1990's where they started declining rapidly. The captivation of the American imagination by violent killers does indeed seem to be prompted by awareness of rising rates of violent crime reports at the time. I can't point you to a particular study that has the fantastic and definitive answer as to why crime rates rose sharply in the beginning of the 60's and fell sharply in the beginning of the 90's, that can tell you what exactly what change lead to this pattern, many have tried to unpack why and how the rates of crime followed this curve, but it is a matter of statistical fact that crime was rising during this time it's not just that documentaries and tv shows were highlighting the killers of this period and all the other times had just as many killers around but with less spotlight and attention.",
        "While I will not add to the possibilities of why it has dropped off, I will contribute that there was less comparative data across jurisdictions before police started storing data electronically, so it\u2019s quite likely there were significantly more serial killers than known before the 1960s, but they were considered to be unrelated individual murders or deaths. More broadly, if you look at homicide rates rather than serial killer rates, they were about as high previous to the 1940s as they were post 1960. So the question may be: \u201cwhy did homicides drop off so much in the \u201840s and \u201850s, and recently?\u201d, as well as \u201cwhy were they so high in the \u201860s through the \u201890s?\u201d This book looks at longer-term patterns and different potential causes and how they might relate to different times."

      "output": [
        "1. Yes 2. Also yes 3. Science is not fact-based: science is *theory*\\-based. The broad idea of science is most clearly explained by the rule of thumb of falsifiability, and has nothing to do with facts, because we only recognize something as a fact once there's a conceptual framework around it. And a scientific theory organizes facts around it. For example, it's a fact that the sun rises in the west, but there were once two competing theories about why: one geocentric, one heliocentric. The geocentric theory was proven wrong to most people who care about science, and now, it's not even a theory anymore, because adherents refuse to accept any evidence disproving that the sun revolves around the earth. If you can't admit the possibility of disproving something, it's not scientific. Now, it would be pretty hard to disprove that the world is round, but the remote possibility still exists, if something really really weird happened and we woke up one morning and it was shaped like a giant burrito (science fiction loves these sort of scenarios). Put simply, we believe in science because it *usually* works, but when it doesn't work or it stops working, we change things so it works better. However, I can't answer the latter part of your question because it's a little unclear. Addressing your issue about social construction, yes, a lot of people use it to mean \"bullshit\", which is wrong. It shouldn't mean that! However, the context matters here, because when social construction is invoked in non-academic arguments, it's usually invoked in a clash between two different theories of the world: right-wing/conservative vs. progressive/scientific. The conservative side says, \"these are the way we do things because people have done this in the past, and it's good that they did this, and we shouldn't change it radically, because otherwise things will fall apart.\" The other side says, \"We do these things not because they're good or right in and of themselves, but because people have commonly done this in the past, and that's not such a good reason, so maybe we can look at some different ideas.\" As an example, someone invoking a traditionalist perspective says \"boys shouldn't wear pink, if you dress your boy in pink that means you want him to be a girl, or gay.\" Another person who disagrees invokes social construction to explain that the pink/blue distinction was only invented in the 19th century and is only valid in some cultures and regions anyway, so you should dress your babies any way you want. The conservative reads this as an attack on gender, identity, their social standing, and the very order of the world. For further reading you might want to check out [this review of the history of sociolog]y (it's peer-reviewed to satisfy the subreddit requirements) or [the Wikipedia definitio]n, which has some interesting stuff in the footnotes. You're absolutely right in saying that just because something is socially constructed doesn't mean it's not important. Even seemingly trivial things, like the pink/blue distinction, have massive real effects on people's lives. Ultimately, everything we perceive is socially constructed because humans are social animals! But there's a difference in degree and type of social construction. Race is socially constructed but not scientific, and here's why. People use highly visible physical markers like skin color to sort people into races, but due to biology and anthropology and genetics and a bunch of other branches, we understand these don't represent useful categories in terms of scientific knowledge. For example, people with very melanin-rich skin are viewed as \"Black\", and in the US context that usually means \"ancestry from a West African region\", but some people who have very dark skin are non-Africans (e.g. Solomon Islanders, Sri Lankans) and not even very closely genetically related to West Africans at all, and of course culturally totally distinct. If these genetically distinct people meet and live together, they might find some commonalities with each other in the way they're reacted to by other people because of their appearance, and this commonality is *also* socially constructed. We read a lot about white people who take a test and are shocked at the results, but this just came to mind: I remember reading about someone who found out [he wasn't Black after taking a genetic test]. As one last example of a socially constructed yet deadly serious invention: borders. You can go to a non-militarized border and put one leg on one side and one leg on the other and you're not going to feel an invisible line of force on your crotch. But that border is deadly real, and it affects some people differently than others depending on your power, bank account, social standing, etc... the richer you are, the less borders affect you. People who are invested in a conservative/right-wing view of the world really don't like to think in these terms, and when they believe something, *they don't like to accept that anything that would happen in future could ever disprove their belief*. This really came to the fore during the pandemic and shocked a lot of people, but not me. People with this perspective can do well for themselves in disciplines like engineering and mathematics and finance, where the numbers change but the social relationships are more static, but the social sciences are very hostile for them. ETA: One more simple reason is that Marx is widely recognized as one of the founders of sociology, **even by sociologists who aren't Marxist politically**. People who are right-wing cannot handle this and absolutely flip their shit once they realize it.",
        "To quote [Stephen Colbert], it is a well known fact that reality has liberal bias. Edit: You also have a misunderstanding of what a social construct is. It doesn't mean something is \"bullshit.\" Social constructs have very real effects on people's lives. If something is socially constructed, it means humans invented it (i.e., it isn't some universal truth that applies to everything in the universe). A great example of a social construct is race. In the United States, someone with a white mom and a black dad would most likely be perceived as black. In South Africa, that same person would almost *never* be perceived as black (in SA, black exclusively refers to people with two black parents). This difference results in how race was constructed on US chattel slavery vs. SA apartheid. That means this person can be black in Chicago, hop on a plane, and stop being black in Cape Town. Nothing about them, their identity, or their skin color has changed. However, the race they are assigned by those around them (and thus the race they \"are\") changed based on social context. In that sense, race is social constructed as there is no objective, universal criteria for what it means to be black; it depends on the social sphere you're standing in. Of course, all of this doesn't change how *real* race is. People believe in their social constructs. Those who are perceived as black in the US are treated different than those who are not perceived that way. Race being a social construct doesn't change that. The point of recognizing it as a social construct, however, is to reveal that the way we think about race is not natural/objective. It's a system that was created for various reasons and one that can be changed because it isn't grounded in anything other than ideas. Edit: To be clear, I'm not trying to argue that social scientists don't tend to be on the left of the political spectrum. We do. I'm pushing back against the notion that these somehow means the research we produce is inherently flawed / neglectful of right-leaning views.",
        "Any study involving Sociology, psychology, or criminal justice are considered liberal. Why? Because conservatives don't follow science based approaches in legislation. The retribution instead of rehabilitation, the list goes on. The far right does not care what conclusion is drawn from scientific study, they just want to do what makes them feel good. If that's throwing a 15 year old in prison for selling weed, or a woman going to jail for getting an abortion, they love it. In their minds they are hurting the right people. They believe that right up until it happens to them or a loved one."

Childhood events don't \"cause\" adult behaviour but they may set a path. But some of the important factors are things like whether the young person interprets the trauma as 'normal' or 'derserved' whether they have a safe adult showing good behaviour in their lives not just the abuse(r) what opportunities and barriers their life holds. A lot comes from how the child copes with the trauma at the time and throughout. Not always saying alcohol is bad - but as an example if a young person starting drinking to cope with abuse may impair their own emotional development and go on to abuse a. because they are intoxicated often but b. avoid reflecting (again not saying alcohol is the key difference its just an example of a path) I'd like to add there is a bit of a longer and more considered difference between systemic colonization type scenarios as well - for example saying \"bounce back\" isn't really accurate is it? - its more that a portion of colonized people will manage to thrive in the new system.

It\u2019s good to get a the root cause, but time and emotional energy is limited and so the psychologist needs to prioritize where efforts are spent. It\u2019s a great question and one that is often asked in clinical work. At the moment I am unaware of any theories or studies specifically attempting to adress the difference between the two that the lead to a standardized methodology to use in clinical practice.",
        "The only thing missing from this discussion is that personality is consistent over time (although as others have mentioned, not static) . So if a patient claims that their symptoms started only recently, or go away in certain circumstances, is episodic, or they present differently on different days, then you can be pretty confident that it isn't the personality that is the issue. The longer the patient has had the symptoms the longer it can take to decern. So personality disorders take longer than other disorders to diagnose while potential other explanations are eliminated.",
        "In the US personality disorders generally aren't diagnosed until someone is over 18 and likely even older than that. By this point personality traits are considered to be deeply ingrained and inflexible although many people with personality disorders have less symptoms as they age. To be considered a PD the symptoms have to be present in virtually every aspect of the person's life regardless of situation and it must cause serious dysfunction. These disorders are highly comorbid with other mental disorders. I believe most of the PDs are thought to stem from maladaptive coping mechanisms formed in childhood due to adverse circumstances. I've read antisocial personality has links to genetics and may present without harmful childhood experiences. If someone has been relatively mentally healthy for most of their life and suddenly, due to a traumatic or unfortunate event, starts showing mental illness symptoms, it wouldn't be a PD. Again with the Antisocial Personality, there must be a diagnosis of conduct disorder or at least clear signs of serious behavior problems before a child turns 15 to be diagnosed with this. PDs are some of the most difficult to recognize and treat. I've read that good psychiatrists and psychologists will spend months or longer meeting with a patient before slapping a personality disorder diagnosis on them.",

In fact, depending on personality the individual may become quite the opposite and act out or become prone to violent outbursts. Your personality is inborn and then molded by experience. Mental Health problems can either exist at birth and become worse through trauma/experience or they can be brought on from trauma /abuse. Either way a \"change of scenery\" does not \"change the man.\" Might help but won't change basic traits and inborn characteristics Edit : word"

      "output": [
        "The trick with questions like these is defining the terms. A lot of psychological terms suffer from also existing with colloquial meanings, that give the impression that they are better defined terms than they actually are. You can end up having a pile of research over here that defines a concept one way, and a different pile over there that defines it a second way, and third and a fourth. The definitions of impulsivity that I am familiar with tend to be a question of how strongly an individual discounts a delayed reward vs an immediate reward. So experiments like, if you don't eat this cookie I'm leaving you with for a few minutes you get two cookies when I get back. The more impulsive subject values one cookie now more highly than two cookies later. Both would theoretically have an impulse to eat the cookie, but the less impulsive subject suppresses the impulse. Short term focus isn't necessarily irrational behaviour or lack of reasoning. In a dangerous situation sometimes things need to happen fast. A person accustomed to having food taken away from them if they don't eat it right away IS making a sensible choice to eat one cookie now. Sure they're told they will get two, by a stranger they have no reason to trust. (Edit: Or a parent they may have reason not to trust.) A lot of behaviour that looks irrational and nonsensical becomes a lot more explicable when you learn to understand and appreciate the context of that person's environment. Getting to instincts, I'm not sure I have encountered a definition of the term I have liked. For the purposes of your question I'd suggest the term is overbroad, and ask if you can be more specific about what kinds of instincts you are interested in.",
        "Instinct can be impulsive. I think, maybe, you're trying to define the distinctions between being instinctual and compulsive, rather than impulsive? Compulsion, according to the dictionary, stems from an irrational impulse, which are therefore, not life affirming acts. While instincts are often also impulsive, act in life affirming ways."

I'd wonder if telehealth could help ease the person into sessions if starting off in-person is too overwhelming. Finally, being very specific about treatment goals, and being clear about what was damaging from the previous experience.

      "output": [
        "In therapy, when therapists use self-disclosure, it is expected to be truthful. However, there are several nuances to consider: Ethical Considerations: Ethically, therapists should not fabricate personal experiences to relate to clients. The American Psychological Association (APA) and other professional bodies have ethical guidelines that emphasize honesty and integrity in therapeutic interactions. Selective Sharing: Therapists may choose to share only certain aspects of their true experiences that are relevant and beneficial to the client's therapeutic process. They are trained to disclose information judiciously to ensure it serves the therapeutic goals. Therapeutic Purpose: The primary goal of self-disclosure is to benefit the client, whether it's to build rapport, provide an example, or enhance the therapeutic alliance. It's not intended for the therapist\u2019s personal sharing or emotional needs. Client Focus: Even when therapists share their experiences, the focus should remain on the client and their therapeutic journey. The disclosure is a tool, not a shift in the session's focus to the therapist\u2019s own life. Boundaries: Therapists must maintain professional boundaries, even when self-disclosing. They avoid over-sharing or creating a situation where roles become blurred. Cultural and Individual Differences: Therapists consider the individual and cultural background of each client to determine the appropriateness and potential impact of self-disclosure. While the truthfulness of a therapist's disclosure is expected, the key is that any self-disclosure should be employed responsibly and ethically, with the client's best interests as the primary concern. If clients have concerns about the use of self-disclosure in their therapy, they should feel empowered to discuss these concerns with their therapist."

I don't believe this is so for ADD and OCD. I assume by ADD you mean ADHD. If not, then all I say may not apply much. OCD and ADHD symptoms don't have a ton of connection. The hallmark of OCD, as you know, is the painful compulsion to perform illogical behaviors. To put it simply, that is OCD; any connection would be something of that to present in ADHD. To my knowledge, there isn't. The only thing I can think of would be hyperfocusing (on compulsion and interesting task, respectively), but the only connection there to my knowledge is the \"focusing intensely on something\"; the way they work in the brain and as a behavior, to my knowledge, do not have a lot in common.

        "several hypothesis for childhood amnesia : Autobiographic memory is build upon episodic memory (around 6 yo) which has a immature state (event memory) that starts to \"appears\" and develops around 3 to 6 yo. It's when kids can predict what they did today, will do next, like tomorrow or predict the chronological steps of a routine (brushing teeths, being read a story and going to bed for instance). Autobiographic memory may rely on language, so it may be difficult to consciously recall stuff from when we hadn't access to verbal concepts to memorize or categorise things. Another hypothesis is that our senses / body is undergoing a lot of changes, and the memories from early childhood cannot be recalled properly. By being taller, being more accurate with our senses etc, an experience from early childhood (like visiting a place) cannot be recalled properly when revisiting it because a lot of the properties of the experience have changed. That being said, people may have memories from early childhood. However, in some cases it's hard to tell if it's a false memory that has been built upon hearing a story told by others, or constructed with present representations of one's childhood. Memory still exists in early childhood though, and consciousness in itself is relevant when talking about a child or a baby since it can be argued that they are conscious about several things regarding their environment and their body sensations. Non declarative memory (ie non verbal memory), like procedural memory, exists in babies. Learning to walk, to touch, to associate a movement with a consequences, involves memory and can be seen as early as a few months after being born. Kids can recognize themselves in the mirror at around 1-2 years old. It's very hard to study babies though, so it's possible that these processes exist even before this age, but we haven't found a way to study it. Edit : the computer memory is not an accurate example of human memory, while it can be used to make some metaphors it really works in a lot of different ways. Computer's are object that store information, like you store information in a piece of paper when you write things. When you pick up the paper, the words haven't changed. Human memory doesn't work like that, it reconstructs mnesic information by involving several neural pathways related to the memory, it doesn't store a 'photograph' of an information like a computer would. Since your brain develops through time, and your neural pathways aren't fixed, your memories may be affected by it. This is especially true in childhood when the brain is undergoing maturation."

More to the point, traditional IQ is mainly useful for predicting academic success. These majors are some of more demanding in terms of conceptual and analytical thinking, which are measured on IQ tests. So it makes sense that these majors would primarily be accessible only to those with higher IQ.",
        "I looked around and found no academic papers supporting this.The only thing I found was some clickbait articles that reference the ETS website. This is not a legitimate scientific resource. They calculated the IQ. It was not an actual IQ measurement. They basically just used SAT scores. And they showed that physics students had the highest SATs. Any type of standardized measurement of \"intelligence\" only measures something specific. It does not measure all forms of intelligence. In the case of the SAT, this measures education. Which is \"learned\". Math is often something that a lot of students struggle with. If you have a test that has many math questions, you can expect that students who know more math are going to score better. And people who like math, learn math, and are more likely to seek out careers with math. So you see where I am going here right? The method for associating the SAT score (because remember, there is no current research supporting a specific IQ for a given field) with a specific field is just saying people who can score high on those type of questions, in this case mathematics, are more likely to go into mathematic fields. FYI, I went to the ETS website and I cannot even find the article showing this that so many click bait articles mention. Its been removed. Likely because it was shoddy research methods. Also the reason there is no current scientific literature giving a breakdown of IQ by major is because this would not really be possible. Firstly, you would need a huge huge amount of IQ testing done on students from everywhere. Not just the best universities but community college, colleges in different countries, people at different levels, and so on. People with PhDs are going to usually score higher on IQ than those with an associates. Even within fields there are big differences. For example, many charts lump all of psychology together but there are two big areas, clinical and academic. Academic requires research. But some clinicians do research. So then you need to seperate those. I am sure this holds true for other fields as well. There are differing levels that are going to make a mess of the results. We also know that things like SES background influence IQ testing due to test biases. So really there is no way to say that any major is more intelligent than another. Its kind of a farce. And people just want this number so they can judge others. Obviously a field that requires higher level math skills will attract people with higher level math skills. Just like careers that require a lot of creative thinking will attract people high on creativity. Working memory is fairly independent from IQ. Though people with really poor working memory tend to have lower IQs (but this might be due to the way the tests are done). But it doesn't hold true in the other direction.",
        "For the record, I study both psychology and math so I did talk to a decent number of people in that field (and adjacent to it). While I agree with what you said, I do think people are underestimating the combined effects of interest level, the difficulty level of the subject, and the demand for jobs that's relevant to their degree. People that want to go into these fields are very aware of how few career options exist but they are also much more willing to accept the consequences of that. In contrast, a large majority of hard sci students will be aiming for cs and stats due to the job stability and these tend to be filled by those that are much more hardworking which may be dragging the average down. As an aside, when I was taking lower level math courses, the non-honour physics (w/o astro) majors tend to fall into one of two groups 1) ones that don't know what they want to do but still enjoy mathematics and physics or 2) ones that weren't able to transfer into cs nor stats but willing to settle for this bc they thought it would still be more employable among the options left. Also, whether the focus is on applications vs theory will vary across different departments and universities. I do also think the curriculum also plays a role but this would be highly dependent on the university. At least in math, I think real analysis is the one hard reality check for students to decide whether or not they want to continue in this field. Besides one engineering specialization, I believe that ph&a students have been heavily recommended to take that course tho it's not a requirement for them. I don't believe there's as hard as that type of reality check in cs and stats (at least not in my uni at the undergrad level).",
        "IQ tests test the type of intelligence that are relevant to stem environments. IQ is a debated measurement because it was designed by white men to test the types of intelligence that were valuable to them at the time. That's not to say that people with high IQs are actually smarter. Just that people with high IQs are better at particular things (ie those things which are important in STEM fields). Importantly IQ can be trained. So it is likely that not only are people with IQ relevant skills attracted to STEM fields, but the longer they study and practice in those fields, the higher their IQ gets."

As we have seen in Brazil especially, cattle ranchers, miners, etc pose a continuing threat of violence to these people. If they have decided that contact with the outside world is something dangerous and worth fearing, there is every reason to believe they are correct in that assessment. \\- there is good reason to believe that initiating contact, even if it was done with the best of intentions and without overt violence, would be highly dangerous to the health and lives of the people contacted.

      "output": [
        "25? from where you got that? In terms of neuroplasticity markers it's way before 25 yr old in humans, there seem to be 3 \"steps\" of maturation, few months after birth, at 5-6 years old with the end of the juvenile amnesia and at 9-12 years old with the entrance to puberty. Nothing appears to happen afterwards except senescence. And the typical age of initiation of psychiatric conditions more or less coincide with those steps.",
        "When we're born we have the most neural plasticity possible, that's the peak, when our brains are brand new. When our brains are brand new we're just constantly growing new brain cells and making new connections all over the place, it's a mad explosion. We don't keep all of those cells or connections bc brain space is finite and we have to prioritize in order to function. A bunch of those cells die (a process called apoptosis which is a search term you can use if you want to read more about this) and a bunch of those pathways die as well in a process called neuronal pruning. By the time we get to age 2 that chaotic explosive time is slowing down and things are starting to get a little bit more set. Brain cells have 2 key parts, an axon that sends signals and dendrites that receive signals. Each neuron has one single axon and many many dendrites which means every brain cell can send only one signal at a time but can receive many all the time. The axon part and the cell body itself cannot move, they're stuck in place, but the dendrites can and do move around somewhat freely. Neural plasticity describes the process by which dendrites that receive signals from the same neurons over and over again actually physically move themselves closer to those axons so that the signals are able to fire more quickly. This is why the learning process is roughly the same no matter what you're learning - slow and hard at first but faster and easier as you do the same thing over and over again. Doing the same thing over and over again tells those dendrites to move closer to those axons which is what builds and strengthens the neural pathway. This also means that overtime unused pathways break down because eventually those dendrites from the old rarely pathway will move to a new more frequently used axon. The more we learn and the more we use all those neural pathways the more \"set\" they get and the more time and energy it takes to change them. Since we learn more as we age the older we get the more set things are as well. We do have less neural plasticity as we age but it's mostly bc while nothing in our brains is truly set in stone it does kinda work like a cart over a dirt path, the ruts can get dug in if you are always doing this one thing the same way forever and as that happens it gets harder to change the position of the ruts and we cant really smooth the path out and start over from scratch. I think the 25 thing is just some people not understanding the myelination process (a separate thing entirely) and thinking that neural plasticity tanks once myelination is complete (roughly age 25 for most people). It's not really that we lose neural plasticity after age 25 it's more than the fewer experiences and habits we have the easier it is for us to build new neural pathways while old habits do indeed die hard. At a certain point learning new things means breaking up old neural pathways and repurposing those neurons and their dendrites for other things simply bc neurons are finite. That doesn't mean we can't learn new things as we age, we can and do! But it does mean that it gets a little harder as time goes on, that's all."

      "output": [
        "Exposure therapy: within window of tolerance Chronic exposure: outside window of tolerance Exposure therapy done well will be carefully titrated so as not to overwhelm. Choose easy wins, side topics, and slowly progress as capacity develops. The goal is the patient learns how to be with and tolerate the emotions, develops skills for managing them and critically, confidence. They get enough time between exposures to integrate the experience, and be balanced/ready for the next go. Chronic exposure has no such balance - you get overwhelmed, and before you can regulate, you get exposed to more. Chronic dysregulation leads to lowered capability to regulate, integrate and find balance, thus increasing the harm of new stressors and usually maladaptive coping mechanisms. Now we have a highly unpleasant and damaging feedback loop. As for your physical training analogy, it's pretty spot on. You NEED rest (regulation), your muscles (nervous system) are weaker after being stressed, and are less able to handle new stress without injury until they return to baseline. The window of tolerance is a good metaphor for this. A manageable amount of stress + rest leads to growth, too much stress leads to damage.",
        "A lot of trauma therapy or exposure therapy *should* be done immediately in conjunction with how to re-train the invasive thoughts. It\u2019s not just exposing you to something with no highly specific guidance, and goal - it\u2019s a lot of specific CBT, CPT, or EMDR. Plus, it\u2019s not done over an 8+ hour workday - even if you\u2019re in such sessions every day, it\u2019s 30-90 minutes, depending. And, longer exposures on the patient\u2019s time, homework; like for agoraphobia (etc, just an example) is still monitored and guided. \u2018Go to the store and buy 3 things, say hello to the cashier\u2026 and then complete worksheets or otherwise document being conscious of thoughts during the exposure. Conversely, when you\u2019re constantly in a state of stress, like at a high-pressure job, no one is guiding you through it but yourself (the ultimate goal of such therapy!), but it\u2019s not a therapeutic model to just BE in constant state of stress without the intent and professional instruction to cope with it. The benefits of the exposure are through extensive teamwork between patient and therapist; and as an aside, it can still be too much, especially if done incorrectly or too soon, and \u2018exposure therapy\u2019 itself is debatably successful (but varies widely.)",
        "You've kind of described resilience, or mental toughness in a way. Depending on factors like your support network, genetics, previous exposure, previous therapy etc at we all have different levels of mental toughness. When you don't know how to process this stress in constructive ways your mind is going to be screaming at you to run, hide, fight this threat. This would be low mental toughness, I can present itself in maladaptive behaviours. Exposure therapies are 1) done with the persons consent (so they feel safe) and 2) require going through other coping strategies before hand so they are prepared for this. If just exposing someone to these stressors improved their resilience then therapy would not be a thing. Doing so would just cause their minds to revert back to those maladaptive strategies because despite it not working, it still feels right for the person. The method this is done will vary from person to person. Some will respond better to logical cognitive therapies and others will respond better to now mindful acceptance therapies. To circle back to your metaphor it would be like trying to deadlift, but never having been shown how to deadlift safely. So you try the deadlift, and you hurt yourself. Your mind feels this is the right way to deadlift and so you continue thinking you just need to get stronger. Then asking comes a professional and goes 'okay, is this working for you? Let's try not using our teeth'.",
        "Craske and other researchers in the field have found that exposure therapy is more about creating new learning experiences rather that habituation or extinction. This process, known as inhibitory learning, involves forming new, neutral or positive memories that can counteract or inhibit the original fear memory. The key aspect of inhibitory learning is the violation of expectation. When an individual anticipates a negative outcome in a fear-inducing situation but the outcome doesn't occur, this creates a salient memory. For example, someone who fears spiders might expect harm upon encountering one. Through exposure therapy, when they encounter a spider and are unharmed, this creates a new memory where the expected harm does not materialize. Over time, or with repeated exposure, these new memories, which are neutral or positive, are strong enough to inhibit the old fear-related memories. It's not just about exposing the individual to the feared stimulus but ensuring that the experience counters their negative expectations, thereby facilitating the creation of these inhibitory memories. There is no research backing that gradual exposure is more effective or a mechanism needed for change: in fact - random exposure creates a greater discrepancy between anticipated and actual outcome and more lasting effects. However, a lot of clients don\u2019t want to partake in that kind of exposure. And gradual exposure helps building confidence. For lasting results it\u2019s more important to exposure to a lot of different contexts and make the experience salient enough."

Too little is bad. The reports on drugs that increase plasticity use animal studies. Furthermore. An increase in plasticity isn't necessarily a good thing.

It's possible that brain changes caused by these drugs is actually incredibly harmful. \"Plasticity\" is over hyped in the media. It's not always a good thing.

Marx writes about this in many places, especially in *Capital vol. 1*. neo-Marxists have run with analysis of such, Baran and Sweezy's *Monopoly Capital* being classic. More contemporarily, David Harvey focuses on various 'fixes' in *Limits to Capital*. Actually, none of this is that contemporary: I've been out of school and the field for a while. Also, there are varied non-Marxist takes, but that was my focus. I'm sure that there are good analyses of gig work, for example, that have come out in the interim.

Like the racism of production workers who sometimes fear (realistically) to be replaced and start to develop hates and stereotypes (often not realistic).

        "Ok so you kinda asked two questions: 1. Why are people racist? I was raised in central Arkansas. I was raised to be racist. It was taught to me the same way science and math were taught to me. It was a simple truth that non-white races were inferior, not quite as human as whites. I was fortunate enough to have moved around the country a lot in my teens, which exposed me to other ideologies and made me question my upbringing. 2. The recent surge in racism: My personal opinion, and that of many of my older associates, is that there is an over-correction effect happening creating toxic homogenous centrism. Some young white men (especially those lacking a positive male role model) feel disenfranchised and are lashing out. I don't think they're a majority, just a vocal minority.",
        "It is a better question to ask why some people are not racist. Pretty much everyone alive, and basically everyone through history, has been racist. I haven't seen any data suggesting that people are more racist now than 10 years or 30 years ago. If anything I would think people are less racist.",
        "It stems from very powerful but generally unconscious insecurity. People who have been deeply violated, especially at a young age, will sometimes seek to dominate others, or cozy up with others they see as powerful. They equate dominance with safety and security. And they deeply fear being violated again, existing in a state of hyper-vigilance that colors their whole worldview. They tend to evaluate others as either potential threats, lackeys, or pushovers they can impose their will on without repercussion. Anyone caught in their orbit may feel forced to toe the line out of fear of what might happen to them if they don\u2019t."

      "output": [
        "So, executive functioning is your brain's ability to use its different functions-- memory, attention, emotional regulation, planning, etc.-- in organized and efficient ways. Executive dysfunction is the blanket term for diminished capacity to do that. When your brain's executive isn't working well, even simple tasks become more challenging. Procrastination is a behavior or pattern of behavior. It's when a person delays doing a task because they find it uncomfortable in some way. Their reasoning can be conscious or unconscious, that is, they may or may not realize that they're putting off the task due to discomfort. It's not the same thing as choosing not to do the task at all-- by definition, procrastination is a delay in something that you still intend to do at some point (even if that delay ultimately results in the task not getting completed). So the major difference between executive dysfunction and procrastination is that one describes a person's cognitive functioning, and the other describes a behavior. Definitely executive dysfunction can lead to procrastination because it can make task completion difficult and uncomfortable, resulting in that task being put off. Not all procrastination necessarily results from executive dysfunction, although I suppose one could make the argument that the cognitive error that underlies procrastination (usually \"this is too hard to do now, but it will be easier later\") is itself a kind of executive dysfunction. Personally, I'd say that's using the term too broadly, but others might argue."

        "Stable, loving parent/s who encourage curiosity, group participation and self-worth are the baseline of healthy child development, but external factors and experiences count for SO MUCH, how would you ever accurately measure something so complex? Having said that - I really wish credentialed professionals had specific flair in this sub, because there are way too many amateurs who are way too confident in their biases chattering away in here.",
        "Personnality and life outcomes are different things : There are more and more studies that link stable personnality traits to genetical and.or environnemental factors outside of parenting But - Bad parenting, and adverse childhood exp\u00e9rience (ACE) Can have an impact on attachment styles, risk taking, anxiety, depression etc - th\u00e8se are not personnality traits ACE or bad parenting doesnt mean a kid is doomed - it can also have a positive effect on resilience on some cases. It can be worked on on later stages of life. Some kids can have mitigating factors as well while growing up (other adults to inspire them - personnality traits or genetical features that makes them more or less vulnerable to ACE) etc",
        "Difficult to answer question. In general, most of psychology follows the principle of the predisposition model. In short, it means most things are a combination of genetics, environmental influences, and the interaction between those two. To give an analogy, you might have a genetic predisposition for heart disease. However if you live incredibly healthy this might never result in heart disease. However if you smoke and are inactive, this might 'activate' the genetic predisposition and trigger heart disease. Getting heart disease then wasn't really to blame on just one factor, but on the combination of multiple factors coming together. You can look up the different heritability factors of different psychological traits and get somewhat of an estimate, but I feel that still oversimplifies the situation. Personality is roughly around 50% heritable. This study suggest the heritability of criminal behavior is 45%. and also clearly states it's a combination of heritability and environment. However it's still almost impossible to say that if a child would've grown up with different parents their outcome would've necessarily been different. Nor is it possible to say that a criminal is only a criminal because their parents didn't raise them well.",
        "I'm curious as to what studies imply that personality traits aren't affected by parenting, and what that specifically means. It's clear that some aspects of personality are inherent, based on siblings having the same upbringing but totally different personalities. However, it's really not so black and white as these things being either nature or nurture. For example, shyness might be an inborn trait, but it can also just as easily be ascribed to someone being made to doubt themselves from a young age. High ambition may result from a naturally exuberant personality, or from pressures put on a child by their parents. So the same trait can be caused by nature or nurture, and only by getting to know the individual can you really know for sure. That said, I think parenting style has a huge effect on people's success later in life, not only because of how it may shape their personality, but even moreso due to what life skills the child may or may not be taught, and material advantages in life. A child who was neglected, wasn't taught any life skills, and sent off to fend for themselves at 18 with little education will certainly have a harder time succeeding than someone who was given more support in life.",
        "I think perhaps the influence of parents on personality per se doesn't need to be that strong. Even without it, parents can have a huge influence on the outcomes in their children. For example, one thing that I haven't seen mentioned by others is that parents can play a very positive or negative role in \"crisis management\". For example if their kids face some hardship or obstacle in life, some parents will help them go through it and overcome it, which would move the kid back to the good life trajectory, while some parents would have poor skills for such crises management, and a certain crises could result in the kid being permanently shifted to a bad/poor trajectory, which could damage their entire life in the future.",
        "It's complex (and quite frankly too complex to really say: Parent did X parent did Y) But agree with other comments - its not really a linear line of influence. e.g \\- severely toxic and neglectful will 9/10 have a major BAD impact Almost all other parenting INTERACTS with the child's genetics and their own decisions and choices as they grow so its borderline impossible to say that parents can be credited or blamed for XYZ.",
        "Research has shown how most life outcomes are a mix of genetics and environment. I think parents have a significant impact on our lives, but so does our own character. I know people whose parents were addicts and yet they've become very well adjusted members of society, and others who sadly followed in their parents' footsteps. So I would definitely say our environment (aka our parents, but also our wider social circle) impacts us, but to what degree varies greatly from person to person."

      "output": [
        "There are several reasons for this, which are summarized and referenced in [this article]. One major aspect we need to take into consideration is the availability of mental healthcare and cultural beliefs around mental health that make it more or less likely to go to a mental health professional. This affects the number of reported cases, which is the data that is used for these studies. There is also the problem of cultural taboos on suicide, so that it is often not registered on death certificates in very religious countries where it is considered a bad thing to do. Another issue is weather, mainly sun hours. The closer you are to the poles, the more likely it is your mood is affected by Seasonal Affective Disorder, aka winter depression. Since the Northern-most countries are also generally wealthier than those around the equator, this skews results. A lot of people in wealthier, Northern countries do more drugs and drink more alcohol than poorer nations. Other factors that affect suicide rates are performance pressures (school, job) and inequality (which is often greater in wealthier countries in the current system). Another is urbanization, where personal space is limited and you have very little control over your environment. These combine into a culture of sink or swim within the system, where only working very hard, according to specific rules set by someone else, is enough to make ends meet and you risk losing everything if you can't cut it, but at the same time, people feel alienated and feel less purpose in life, because life is just working at a soulless job without a clear purpose and sleeping. People are not designed for continuous high stress environments. We are designed for spikes of high stress and then relaxing. The constant stress leads to more disruptions in the cortisol axis, which leads to depression and anxiety, which leads to more suicide and hikikomori."

In this case, the survey is not actually measuring how much pain people feel, but is measuring how much pain people predict they will feel. So it\u2019s important to keep that in mind \u2014 we don\u2019t actually know what pain means to these folks, or what they actually feel in various situations. But we can explore why people think some situations will produce more pain. In this case, I think cognitive biases impact these answers. There is a bias called the [self-serving bias] where people tend to blame others for their actions, but blame external factors for their own actions. For example, when someone cuts us off in traffic we assume they are bad drivers or selfish or stupid. But when we accidentally cut people off in traffic, we think \u201coops, my vision was blocked, I didn\u2019t see that car.\u201d So when we imagine someone else causing us pain, we imagine they are it doing on purpose. When we imagine causing our own pain, we imagine an understandable accident.

In actuality, I don\u2019t think this survey is reflects how much pain we would actually experience because different situations would produce different answers.

        "This seems like a pretty straightforward question that you could use google for... but it's actually worth writing a better answer than just telling you to do that. Check out the Bureau of Justice Statistics to see what their [reports and data] might say regarding numbers. However, I think it bears mentioning that determining whether something was gang-related or not probably has some high error rates. If they're using the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), the determinant of whether a crime was gang-related or not is *whether the victim perceives the offender to be a gang member*. You can probably imagine what the issues with this are. So I am not surprised that \"gang activity\" is not often reported with NCVS results. Additionally, if the numbers are being collected from individual police stations or prosecutors, they would probably under-count the proliferation of gang activity, because they can only speculate on whether a case is gang-related until it's closed. There's a [report from 2010] that doesn't seem to describe an overall rate, but does point out that the description of something as \"gang-related\" or not needs clarification and context. For example, \"gang-related\" could mean that a homicide was a gang member killing another gang member. Or it could mean that a gang member killed another innocent person. The definition of \"gang\" is itself vaguely defined. Young men who tend to associate with each other and commit crimes [are not necessarily a gang] by federal definition, yet you might hear the news refer to the group as such. That is, being a group of people who commit crimes is necessary, but not sufficient, for being a gang. Example: Bobby Shmurda of [Hot N\\*\\*\\*\\*] fame was prosecuted as being a member of the gang \"GS9,\" yet their group may not have fit some of the definitions for being a \"gang\" (whether they were or not was irrelevant to them being subject to RICO). To wrap up, an [old report from 2008] seems to indicate that only 6% of the homicides in their data were gang-related, and I didn't see a more updated report. However, to circle back to the above points, I don't see in this report how they defined \"gang-related.\""

        "Not a psychologist but I run into studies by some. You're going to get different answers out of different epistemologies, which is already kind of what you're saying when you set up a contrast between psychoanalysis and Marxism but we can add to different dimensions of that. In support of your point: Contents of hallucinations and delusions vary by culture. Stompe, T., Friedman, A., Ortwein, G., Strobl, R., Chaudhry, H. R., Najam, N., & Chaudhry, M. R. (1999). Comparison of delusions among schizophrenics in Austria and in Pakistan. Psychopathology, 32(5), 225-234. Example search: You might be able to find more in there about the specific positive and negative valence of delusions or hallucinations with respect to culture. In general your points are compatible with Bronfenbrenner's widely accepted biopsychosocial model and the general orientation of social work and family therapy towards treating things systemically. There were also a bunch of news stories a few years ago about successes of household and community integration of people with mental health struggles in Belgium: I would posit that at least some of the difficulty in coming up with a general answer has to do with a mismatch between how we can know this stuff at a broader scale and how to answer the very concrete and arguably quantitative nature of the question \"*how much of it* is due to capitalism?\" Let's take BPD as one example where there's a *lot* of developmental and factorial research on it. BPD has a bunch of known genetic factors that can predispose a person to difficulties with emotion regulation, *and* also has a lot to do with abusive environments in early childhood. Those abusive environments though also tend to go with lower socioeconomic status, higher prevalence of violence in the community and similar things that we could speculate might be associated with the particular thing that you have in mind behind the label \"capitalism\". For example: Chanen, A. M., & Kaess, M. (2012). Developmental pathways to borderline personality disorder. Current psychiatry reports, 14(1), 45-53. So it's pretty clearly established that economic and power structures can both contribute to worsening mental health symptoms. I don't think we can get that to an answer like \"X% of mental illness is due to capitalism\" though. It gives us places to intervene. Some people in the field feel much more strongly than that that a revolution in economic systems is a moral or ethical imperative in order to help people out, some feel the opposite, some people in between. We could probably find more info on pathway analyses between things like strength of social safety net, inequality and mental health symptoms, for reasons that are both intuitively and experimentally plausible. I don't know if that would satisfy the terms of the comparison though. The Belgium example for one looks like an instance of a program that seems pretty non-capitalist if not anti-capitalist in spirit but that takes place against the backdrop of a country that I think it would be fair to call capitalist. Do we need to compare outcomes against the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam in order for the question to really be answered? Against co-op organizations in Spain or communalist Rojava?"

      "output": [
        "It matters a lot. Those companies have massive influence on the information that gets reported versus the information that doesn't. There was some talk in the past few decades that the internet changed all of this -- that the internet \"democratizes\" information. After all, if everyone can \"publish\" their ideas on the internet, then does it really matter who owns the media? Well, for one, just because you can put information on the internet, doesn't mean anyone actually sees it. But further, we've moved in a direction where now it's just a few companies that own all of the social media platforms. And then, I've been seeing reports recently that most (close to all) \"independent\" content creators (on sites like Youtube, TikTok, etc...) actually have become employees of some kind of wealthy agency. My understanding is that they're employed by sort of like a talent agency, and then they get the power of that wealth behind them and it helps in audience reach. Moreover, if you have these \"independent\" content creators who are backed by wealthy corporations, this means it's virtually impossible for a truly independent content creator to get any attention. The bottom line then is that within just the past couple of decades, after a period in which the internet was somewhat uncontrolled, massive companies have re-asserted power over the flow of information on the internet too. This all has powerful influence on the information you see and don't see. By the way, it is very easy to let your concerns for this kind of thing slip into conspiratorial thinking that is essentially useless. You'll see conspiracy theorists on subs like /r/conspiracy talking about this problem of concentrated media ownership, but they go to ridiculous extremes (for example, suggesting there's been some effort to manufacture a fake school shooting at Newtown, and media companies colluded to fake it; or media companies helped cover up for the US government planning 9/11). This is the wrong way to direct your concern about concentrated media ownership and the influence of wealthy companies on the flow of information. The thing is, conspiratorial thinking like this is lazy and unimaginative. It's what only someone under age 25 should think is the problem. The problem is more complex and insidious. To me, instead, it's helpful to think about what is the motive of these wealthy companies? Simple: to keep their money and get wealthier. So they want to stifle competition. And if they can maintain power over the flow of information and preserve and grow the power they have from their inordinate wealth, they can prevent emerging people/organizations from gaining a foothold, increasing their wealth, and competing with them. I also think it's valid to consider that these media/information companies may have a political agenda and wield political influence, and this agenda also goes back to money. Think of the Supreme Court's \"Citizens United\" decision. Fundamentally, this is a decision that impacts media. We used to have stronger regulations on how much money any entity could spend on using media to influence politics. So Citizens United basically drastically reduces any kind of control we ever had on how much money a company/person could spend using media to influence people, to influence the political process, and so to influence who people vote for. The result is that the political influence of super wealthy organizations has become virtually unlimited, and so now they are free to spend as much as they want to influence the media/information that the public as a whole sees. And so in the US, let's say one party is more friendly to letting the wealthiest corporations keep their wealth and influence. Those corporations would have a powerful incentive to do things to try to ensure that this political party preserves its power. Of course, they cannot literally control the media because we still have other forces in society -- we have independent-minded journalists and small media organizations and we have large masses whose views fall on every part of the political spectrum. So those massive corporations are still going to try to capitalize on making money via media that appeals to everyone, and so we're still going to see a broad range of political perspectives in the media. But they're still going to try to preserve the political balance in media content that ensures they keep their wealth. And the more you make the power dynamic unequal, the more those corporations can be successful in limiting the extent to which their influence and power-through-wealth is challenged.",
        "Monopoly has several consecuencies. Reduced competition: The most apparent consequence of a monopoly is the lack of competition. With no or limited competitors, the monopolistic firm faces little pressure to improve its products, offer better prices, or innovate. As a result, consumers may have fewer choices and potentially receive lower-quality products or services. Higher prices: A monopoly can exploit its dominant position to set higher prices, as consumers have no alternative options. This leads to reduced consumer surplus, meaning people pay more for goods or services than they would in a competitive market. Lower quantity and variety: Monopolies may limit the quantity and variety of goods or services available. Since they control the market, they can choose to produce fewer units or offer fewer product variations to maximize their profits. Inefficiency: Without competition, monopolies may become less efficient over time. There is less pressure to cut costs, innovate, or improve processes, leading to potential waste and inefficiency in the production process. Barriers to entry: Monopolies can create significant barriers to entry for potential competitors. High entry costs, legal restrictions, or exclusive access to resources can prevent other firms from entering the market and challenging the monopoly's position. Income inequality: Monopolies can exacerbate income inequality in society. The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a single entity or a small group can lead to a significant wealth gap between the monopolistic firm's owners and the general population. Political influence: Monopolies can gain considerable political influence due to their economic power. They may lobby governments to create or maintain policies that favor their interests, potentially leading to a distortion of public policy. Innovation suppression: In the absence of competition, monopolies may have less incentive to invest in research and development or develop new products. This can stifle innovation and limit technological progress in the industry. Consumer exploitation: With limited or no alternatives, consumers may be left with little choice but to accept the monopoly's terms, even if they are unfavorable. This can lead to exploitative practices by the monopolistic firm. Reduced economic growth: Monopolies can hinder overall economic growth. Higher prices, limited output, and reduced innovation can have negative impacts on productivity and economic efficiency. Those are the materialistic consecuences. The cultural consecuences are something that you should be concerned about Limited Diversity: A cultural monopoly might stifle diversity in cultural expression by favoring mainstream, popular, or commercially viable content, neglecting niche or minority perspectives. Suppression of Alternatives: Smaller, independent creators and artists may struggle to compete with the resources and influence of the monopoly, leading to a suppression of alternative voices and perspectives. Censorship and Control: The controlling entity may use its power to censor or manipulate cultural content to align with its own interests or political agenda, potentially restricting freedom of expression. Cultural Homogenization: A cultural monopoly can lead to the homogenization of cultural products, as unique regional or local expressions may be overshadowed by mass-produced content. Market Manipulation: The monopoly may engage in unfair practices, such as price fixing or anti-competitive behavior, leading to limited consumer choices and higher prices. Loss of Cultural Heritage: When a cultural monopoly prioritizes mainstream or commercially viable content, traditional and indigenous cultural expressions may be marginalized or lost. Inequality and Access Issues: A cultural monopoly may limit access to cultural content, especially for underserved or marginalized communities, exacerbating social and economic inequalities. Decline in Creativity and Innovation: A lack of competition may reduce incentives for innovation and creativity, as the dominant entity might become complacent and less motivated to explore new ideas.

        "The most important thing I\u2019d say for writing a character with a struggle you haven\u2019t experienced is this: Remember that all disorders occur on a spectrum. What one person experiences someone else may not. Don\u2019t cram every aspect of BPD into their personality and leave no room for anything else. While for some people this can become their reality with severe and especially unmedicated BPD (or any disorder), oftentimes BPD is not something you can immediately tell someone has. They have lives and they certainly have other unrelated flaws. For BPD specifically, make sure you are aware of the differences between Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar 1 and Bipolar 2. They all overlap but there are differences. Changes in the character\u2019s mood/temperament are also not always obvious. Plus, they\u2019ve been living with it, so perhaps they\u2019ve already formed their own coping mechanisms as well that may make it less prominent.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t, personally. If you don\u2019t know enough about the disorder already (from personal experience - whether you, or someone close to you), I think the chance of an inaccurate portrayal is high. The most likely two outcomes are minimizing the impacts it can have on everyone around the character (and the character), or inaccurately portraying in simplistic black & white terms (eg victim vs abuser) Besides, a disorder in the end is a cluster of symptoms, it categorizes but it doesn\u2019t box someone in. cluster B disorders are extremely misunderstood by the general population, so if I really wanted to portray someone with bpd in a story, the best method I think would be show don\u2019t tell - explain the symptoms and the person\u2019s personality (under the guise of what you understand BPD to be - after research of course). don\u2019t label it bpd. You\u2019re not going to see cormac McCarthy labeling the guy in no country for old men as having antisocial personality disorder, but regardless we know by his actions.",
        "We\u2019re not supposed to share personal experience with mental health in comments or posts on here but I have BPD and my entire immediate family besides my dad have all also been diagnosed so if you want, we could PM and discuss some different traits, behaviors, symptoms, etc. that would be relevant, and i could give you quite a few varied examples of many different possible presentations.",

Their traumas that may of lead to them developing the disorder. How might their past and the way in which they cope with it impact the way in which they handle things now with taking into account their BPD. That\u2019s how i\u2019d go abt it!",
        "Have you subbed to the BPD subreddit? A lot of us pour our hearts out there. I don't want to get into it very much at the moment but if I had to summarize my BPD: It is age development halting cause of trauma. I have the body of a 31 year old but the social coopings of a 2 year old. In many ways I am still a young child or even a toddler. And I have developed no identity for myself. My entire life I felt like I am 20% actually alive and in my body, and 80% like I am already dead and live in the afterlife in my head. And are just waiting till my body dies. I never felt like an adult, I feel like everyone around me is more mature then I am, even if they are way younger. I have literally met an 11 year old girl that honestly was waaay more mature then me and had developed her social skills waay beyond any point I have. I can't understand \"normal\" people and how their brains work. I don\u2019t understand how everyone is not running around screaming while tearing their hair out 24/7. I am in constant fight or flight mode, If I had a wish I would wish to be alone with my GF on this planet as everyone else scares me. I am constantly fighting with myself internally. I am my own biggest enemy and have a lot of self hatred . I have a constant feeling that I don't deserve to exist. I feel like the whole world does not want me to exist. I will always put myself last and will neglect every need or want to please others in a desperate attempt to be acknowledged in my existence. While at the same time claw, manipulate and backstab my way to things I need to survive. As I feel I am not allowed to exist I am literally incapable of asking anything from anyone. I can't even ask my own GF if she could grab a snack or drink for me from the kitchen, as I feel I don\u2019t deserve any help. So I have to get my needs by taking them and achieving them in other ways, often at the cost of others. Which puts me in a circle of constant shame and guilt for doing this and mistakes I made when my emotions get the better of me. When scared or angry, I become a wounded animal that is drowning and will drag down anyone near me with me. I feel like the whole world is my enemy and people are always out to abuse me. And therefore avoid social contact as much as possible. I literally ignore people and run away when someone on the street wants to ask me a question like directions or something. I can't do my shopping in stores as I am to scared that employees or cashiers will talk to me. I am also always disassociating and in my head 24/7. My brain never stops and I am constantly ranting to myself in my head. I am always so exhausted from this mental fight that I barley can function in daily life. Most of the time I am paralyzed in my dissociation. I started using psychedelics 2 years ago and they have helped tremendously with self love and healing trauma though. And are on my way to be \"cured\" from intense self therapy. So the things I named luckily aren't as prevalent anymore as they used to be."

Institutional outcomes? Some kind of access or rights?). And then we figure out how to measure that. So if you think racism is about individual's holding prejudiced idea, you can do self-report surveys, you could do experiments like the [doll study] or the one (I forget the name) where they showed kids pictures of various everyday moments and asked them to explain what was happening in the pictures. Then they analyzed the responses for evidence of different meanings based the race of the kids in the pictures. If you want to understand racism as a structural fact you can gather data on specific institutions and outcomes. For example in education -- you can explore enrollment and retention numbers, gpa's etc to see if there is a pattern of outcomes. You would need to combine that data with data on the faculty and administration, explore policies, survey or interview students on their experiences. You would need a portfolio of measurements to establish a structural pattern. [Here is a nice paper on the topic for epidemiologists.]",

And the thing about a consequence is that there is no guarantee that the other person will ever be ready to forgive. A consequence is 100% their choice, you get no vote about it. Thry are in control. So, consequences are very powerful for the wronged person. Complaining or asking for change is that person giving the person who hurt them the control.

This is not to discredit the idea of implicit bias, but the research on it is pretty weak AND the \"trainings\" to improve implicit bias seem actually like a scam. A lot of implicit bias is based off the implicit association task, which in my mind from reading A LOT about it is not scientifically rigorous. For example, when starbucks made their staff do implicit bias training despite almost no evidence that it works in anyway. As many folks have mentioned, there a million compelling studies about how people discriminate against minorities (e.g., apartment applications etc) and good research about how EXPLICIT DEI trainings can be valuable.

Fear of black criminality was stoked in order to build support for slavery as the only way to protect white people and white property from black folks.

I would definitely recommend doing some reading on critical thinking and information literacy.  Step one is pull apart the separate issues you are lumping together to ask your question. The Philadelphia rioting was in response to the failure of the DA to prosecute a police officer for murdering Eddie Irizarry.  You may not like that as a form of political protest, but it has been a common form of political protest in socio-economically unequal cities for as long as we have had them. If you look at American history there are as many or more examples of white rioting and looting as there are black rioting and looting. This is a structural outcome of treating groups of people in society as less than human, and denying them the basic right to live and the means of living. It is akin to fighting back against an abuser, but on a macro level. Shoplifting is a completely different issue. And organized smash and grab attacks are a third issue.

        "I'm drawing on the work of Benedict Anderson and Ernst Gellner for this answer. Nationalism is best understood as a political impulse. Prior to the late 1700s, most people lived in multi-ethnic Empires. Because of the rise of literacy, print media, mass education and conscription, people began to develop a series of beliefs that we term 'nationalism'. These were: A. They were part of a distinct cultural group. B. This distinct cultural group which they were a part of was a distinct national group, which had a clear language and cultural traditions. C.Their nation should not be part of an empire, but should have its own sovereign state. We call the resultant entity the 'nation-state' A nationalist can be understood as someone who just thinks that their nation as a clear cultural entity exists and should have its own sovereign state. Most people actually have this belief, so you can argue that most people are, in fact, nationalists. Why then are nationalists often regarded as 'hateful idiots'? Some reasons are; Belief in a nation often becomes the belief that your nation and its people are better than other nations and people's, which often leads to prejudice against others. Just because you believe your nation should be sovereign, it doesn't mean you believe other nation-states, or empires should be sovereign, nationalists are often very happy to rule over other national groups regardless of their wishes. Nationalists often believe that their nation has certain 'historic' boundaries which must be restored. This is called 'irredentism' and has lead to many wars, as nationalists push for their desired borders, even as this leads them into conflict. Nationalist desires for sovereign states often interferes with reasonable efforts for international cooperation, as they worry about their nation loosing out. Sources/further reading; Imagined communities by Bennidict Anderson (This is probably the most widely read academic book on nationalism) Nations and nationalism by Ernst Gellner Encounters with nationalism by Ernst Gellner Thought and change by Ernst Gellner",
        "In my thesis, I borrowed from Benedict Anderson's definition of the nation, and expanded it to a working definition of nationalism: Nationalism is a political ideology which states that a certain group constitutes a nation--an imagined political community, imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign--and is therefore entitled to a nation's right of self-determination. To Anderson, the essential feature of nationalism is its modularity. Once established, the nationalist framework is easily transposed between specific contexts, a feature which Anderson ties closely to the ability of modern print capitalism to essentialize the prestige vernacular, creating new structures of power centered around communication and the exchange of information, thus turning linguistic geography into political geography. This definition is not uncontested, and I have been somewhat critical of Anderson's argument about the origins of nationalism, but his definitions are by and large quite good. It's important to note that there is nothing integral to this base-model nationalism that puts it clearly on the right or left. Nationalism on its own has very little to say about the political, social, and economic structure *within* the nation, nor does it have much to say about how the nation engages with those outside its boundaries. What it *does* do is self-replicate, almost without effort. If you put up a fence around your yard, you haven't just delineated your own space, but also your neighbors' spaces. They now have to engage with physical space on your terms. They cannot simply choose to pretend your fence doesn't exist. Thus, nationalism becomes not just a belief, but a paradigm. Here's the thing, not everybody will agree on the limits of the nation, or its internal and external conduct, and this is where you start to see political divisions emerge. Different people can define the same nation according to different criteria. Some people might define a nation linguistically, others religiously, others geographically, and others still economically. Group A and group B speak the same language, but group A lives by the ocean, and group B lives in the mountains, leading to very different ways of life. Are they the same group (on the basis of language) or two groups (on the basis of geography and lifestyle)? There's no impartial answer. Then there is the problem of deviations from the norm. If you define the nation as \"people who speak language X\", but there's a pocket of people who speak language Y in the same area, how does the political system react? In this regard, understanding Anderson's main case study, revolutionary France, is exceptionally helpful. I disagree that it's the ancestral example, which is how he treats it, but it's certainly a useful one.

        "You are talking about 'experimenter effects' which includes a whole host of problems (the [Hawthorne effect] for example, and [demand effects] as another example). Generally they are regarded as problems in experimental designs, and experimenters try to eliminate them, that is, they try to remove experimenter effects from the experiment's estimate of whatever effect is being estimated. There are a few strategies experimenters use to do this, the most common of which is piloting the experiment, i.e., doing a limited run of the experimental design that focuses more on how participants understand and interact with the experimental instruments and less on the actual effects being studied. Pilot data is then used to diagnose any problems with the experimental design and inform any needed changes prior to the full run. Another solution is to randomize the actual experimenters (the laboratory staff interacting with the participants) across the experimental conditions. For example, if you have a particularly gregarious experimenter, having them be equally likely to interact with participants in both the treatment and control conditions of the experiment will control for any effect their friendliness introduces into the experimental situation. This assumes that features of the experimenter (say, their gender) do not interact with features of the experimental conditions, but again, this is the sort of thing you should figure out when you pilot your experiment. Useful discussion of these problems can be found in chapters 6 and 8 of [\"Laboratory experiments in the social sciences.\"]"

More generally, he might have a difficult time trusting people in small things as well. Cognitive dissonance might be at play as well. I assume your character is pretty conflicted about the whole thing. When people experience cognitive dissonance, they tend to change their attitudes and/or behavior in an attempt to reduce the dissonance. So, in his case, he might become more intensely supportive of what you call \"the crowds and various other ideas on morallity.\" On the other hand, if your character regrets his decision, to resolve the dissonance, he might become more intensely supportive of people like his wife, and start working to defend them. Or, he might become more religious, believing in fate to justify his behavior (ie. \"this is the way God meant it to be\"), or becoming pious to atone. If he regrets it and doesn't change his behavior, he may simply change his view of himself and descend into a spiral of self-hatred and poor choices where he decides he's a bad person, and then that perpetuates a series of unfortunate events. In that case, he might see it as justice at first. A reasonable attitude change about himself which he sees reflected in the outside world. There are many ways that people resolve cognitive dissonance... When we do so, we do it in such a way as to increase our experience of a cohesive narrative, beneficial or not."

Similarly, they can have psychogenic amnesia. The best mark of a psychogenic symptom is if they can be shown to be \"neurologically impossible\", as in the case of glove paralysis. However, a \"neurologically impossible amnesia\" isn't, as far as I know, as simple to determine, and this makes it a difficult diagnosis."

      "output": [
        "So there's a simple answer, which is that a lot of social science shares bedfellows with artists. However, there's another element, which is how the concept of subjectivity emerged, which I am more familiar with. Bodies have a very specific connotation that stretches back to developments in the Renaissance. The concept here of subject is the question of what it is subject to - to be a subject is to be subjected to something (Law, the State, Church). Due to the Enlightenment, there was a significant push to conceive the subject as a contained being, subject to their own mental and physical containment. The most straightforward is Descartes and the mind-body dimension. This changed during the modernist period (of which what that period entails is heavily debated), since people were seen more as units concerning a broader structure: structures of production, language, of culture, so the body becomes a useful site upon which a lot of these tensions are discussed. The human body now stops being a thing which is us but us as people in motion: we work, resist, do things. In this sense, if the body is also defined by its doing alongside its boundaries, then it plays double duty as something setting things in motion alongside bearing the traces of its constituent components. These questions of people concerning structures that make and affect them turn people from individualized, self-contained units into meshed subjects comprised at an instance, for a reason, with a motion, etc. It's also important not to discard the influence of French psychoanalysis in studies of subjectivity: regardless of what you think of them, Freud and later Lacan would have outsized influences on how we think of not only internal conceptions of the self but also reflections of the structures in which the self positions itself (see: Althusser, Zizek, etc.). This is where bodies also become vital, as bodies also form one of the big sites of analysis for later feminist theory: Julia Kristeva in Bodies That Matter and Luce Irigaray in The Sex Which is Not One critically engage with the fundamental core nature of the human body, that because we've so deeply tied our sense of subjectivity to a conception of the self-contained male body (that we have a sense of holistic oneness that defines our boundaries), a reexamination of the subject requires a reexamination of the body. To both Kristeva and Irigaray, the female body is a body without boundaries: it is a porous body (see: menstruation). Bodies were also useful for engaging with meshed interactions based on things like desire. That's how Deleuze and Guattari starts Anti-Oedipus: the human mouth isn't just an eating machine, it is a vomiting machine; what sort of machine it is depends on configurations beholden to structures like culture and time, but also bears physiological conditions that - like how Kristeva might argue - metaphorically tie back to a \"form\" (we don't want to vomit, we know how to eat, etc.). The human body is a useful academic shorthand for many things that extend beyond people. It's usually used as a way to think about people, not just as singular actors making decisions but as a collision of forces and factors where the author wants to stress beyond them but doesn't want to necessarily bog the reader down in what extends beyond it. And it's important to note that this isn't a uniquely Western thing: Frederic Jameson (The Political Unconscious specifically) talks about the autonomy of mind in the caduveo face painting. Outwards, we \"notice\" the face painting, but inwards, it is a natural record, a notice imprinted on the body which comprises the sedimentary form of the person painting it. Another is Yoshikuni Igarashi, who noted that after the war, there was a significant amount of debate over the direction of the state. Still, it was always negotiated through discussions about bodies. Thus, questions of luridity, how to depict bodies, etc., were interlocked with the state's direction (or aimed direction). I recommend Nick Mansfield's [Subjectivity]; he charts a few ways subjectivity (and thus bodies) are traced."

      "output": [
        "Hi, OP. My evolutionary psychology colleagues would suggest that jealousy primarily serves the function of retaining access to current or potential mates/other people of importance. Jealousy most commonly occurs because we perceive someone else as a threat to our relationship with a person we value and we fear they will take them from us. For example, a man may feel jealous after seeing their partner talking to another man. Alternatively, a child may feel jealous of their new-born sibling because their mother now pays much more attention to the baby than to them; obviously, the child will not *actually* lose their mother, but they will receive a reduction in the amount of attention they receive and this is often experienced as a painful loss. So, ultimately, jealousy motivates a person to try and prevent a painful relational loss by securing the relationship against outside threats (e.g. other people). Unfortunately, a lot of behaviours motivated by jealousy are often harmful and actually push a person's partner (or whomever they feel jealousy towards) further away, making it increasingly likely they will leave. Additionally, jealousy is far more likely to occur if the following criteria are met: * The person highly values the person involved (e.g. a parent/romantic partner etc.). * The person beliefs they themselves are somehow inferior to the person threatening the relationship. * The person generally has a low opinion of their own self-worth. * The person secretly believes they are undeserving of the existing relationship. Learning how to manage the emotion of jealousy is essential for healthy relationships. Hope that helps :)"

In other words, we seek to heal from situations in regard to our emotions so that we may discern their meaning in full. Compare how emotions affect decisions versus how judging or evaluating a situation dispassionately affects a decision. The latter is ideal in a perfect information system.

However, I would like to refer you to the definition of abuse as formulated by the American Psychological Association: \u201cinteractions in which one person behaves in a cruel, violent, demeaning, or invasive manner toward another person or an animal. The term most commonly implies physical mistreatment but also encompasses sexual and psychological (emotional) mistreatment.\u201d Further more, the American Psychological Association defines emotional (psychological) abuse as follows: \u201ca pattern of behavior in which one person deliberately and repeatedly subjects another to nonphysical acts that are detrimental to behavioral and affective functioning and overall mental well-being. Researchers have yet to formulate a universally agreed upon definition of the concept, but they have identified a variety of forms that emotional abuse may take, including verbal abuse; intimidation and terrorization; humiliation and degradation; exploitation; harassment; rejection and withholding of affection; isolation; and excessive control.\u201d Based on this, I would say that the behaviour you described, as performed by a parent towards their child could be seen as psychological or emotional abuse. However, this does depend on situational and emotional factors and the one sentence you described is simply not enough to judge on that. Either way I would say that these behaviours are important for a psychologist to gain insight into the parent-child relationship. From countless examples of research we now know that various kinds of emotional abuse can have severe and long-lasting psychological effects, and treating those effects through therapy has increasingly become part of psychological training and education. Back in the day the extent to which emotional abuse affected a person was not well understood, and this many psychologist underestimated this effect or even dismissed the existence of it. However, I do believe this is no longer the case. Hope you find what you are looking for, and I wish you the best",

The problem in my eyes is that this is not as high as physical abuse when it comes to bodily harm. (High as in prioritized) And grading abusive against each other is a disservice as the outcome is what matters, and even i am biased towards physical, sexual and bodily harm abuse being seen as more sever, but for a victim of verbal, noise and other forms, this is not gonna be the case at all. But i see no reason why verbal abuse, should be not considered as abusive, and can give rise to issues both somatic, psychosomatic or psychotic (in the psychi not as in the other way)."

        "Evo-psych is a minefield of guesswork, and anyone trying to give you a definitive answer has to make modern interpretations of people who, at their most recent, lived in a context so alien it is difficult to adequately describe on paper. Once we get into talking about proto-humans (as this question implies) and their development, we're reaching back further than we have more than the barest records of existence and location, let alone society. There are lots of interesting concepts and theories, but please understand that \"evolutionary psychology\" is extremely shaky, and more prone to bias (because of the amount of gaps that need filling by the researcher) than virtually any other. Not that it's not a fascinating subject -- just one we can't really give an informed answer on without a time machine to allow us to gather actual data. Otherwise we're not really practicing science; we're just telling stories that sound \"right\" to us.",
        "I'm always curious what people consider to be bragging because I think people should talk about whatever is going in in their lives ... If they have accomplishments or get a promotion, or win an award, or are going on an epic trip, or whatever, why should they not be able to talk about it? I have heard of ALL of these things and similar things be referred to as bragging when someone mentions them or is excited about them. It seems like jealously to always talk about people bragging. What if they love their life and are happy, positive, successful people? Should they never talk about their lives? Unhappy people always think others are bragging.",
        "It nominally drives us to perform behaviors which showcase desirable traits to potential mates, which nominally improves an individual's chance to pass on their genes. For instance, showing off financial wealth, intelligence, or physical prowress increases the chance that a potential mate notices these desirable traits, which nominally increases the chance of them wanting to mate and pass on the braggart's genes. This is just one possible reason why bragging gives a potential evolutionary advantage, since I imagine there are probably many more in our social species."

      "output": [
        "Schizoid personality disorder affects individuals in various ways, to be honest. People with this disorder often find it challenging to connect with others emotionally and may prefer to spend time alone rather than engaging in social activities. They might appear distant or uninterested in forming close relationships. When it comes to the physiological reasons behind schizoid personality disorder, I know studies that suggests that a combination of factors contribute to its development. These factors include genetics, environmental influences, and differences in brain structure and function. Studies have shown that individuals with schizoid personality disorder may have specific abnormalities in certain areas of the brain that are involved in processing emotions and understanding social cues. These differences could impact their ability to experience and express emotions, as well as hinder their capacity to engage in social interactions. Search for the article mentioned below, it is very enlightening and will provide some basis. The article is 2011, but it remains current. \"Schizoid personality disorder: a synthesis of developmental, dynamic, and descriptive features\" Authors: Benjamin F. Schalet, M.D., Ph.D., John M. Oldham, M.D. Journal: The American Journal of Psychiatry Year: 2011",
        "Some interesting research showed a strong link between schizophrenia and over activation of c4 complement component 4. Basically, c4 marks a synapse with c3, and then the synapse gets pruned (removed). This is a normal process during childhood development as we are born with too many neural connections, but too much pruning can lead to schizophrenia. Not enough pruning can lead to seizures. What could cause the over activation of c4? I would suggest factors such as stress of the mother, inflammation, deficiency in vitamins and minerals during pregnancy, etc. Perhaps epigenetic reasons."

It is exotic, erotic, with an edge of danger, mystery, and sinister subterfuge. If American women are strong willed, independent, outspoken, rebellious \"fraus\" who cuckold men and rebuke them... then Asian women are imagined and perceived and assumed to be delicate, submissive, beautiful and available. What all of this means is that these stereotypes about \"The Orient\" and \"Asian women\" is that they permeate our thinking, they inform our unconscious assumptions about \"the Other\" and \"ourselves.\" People think \"Asia\" or \"Japan\" or \"China\" or wherever is (1) some magical fantasy land of perfection, (2) a cheap place where Americans can live large, or (3) [sometimes a dangerous, sinister rival that wants to \"cheat\" us...] Simply put, a fetishized fantasy strokes mens egos. And for nerds who rarely \"get the girl\" and feel extra nervous/anxious/marginalized in hypermasculine western society, East Asian women can be even more desirable. It's not just a reddit thing, but I think the argument can be made that among marginalized men, it may be especially pernicious."

        "for anthropological work addressing why just directly asking people to do abstract analysis of concepts like 'culture' doesn't tend to produce much of value, check out Clifford Geertz's essays in *The interpretation of cultures* and *Local Knowledge*, particularly \" 'From the the native's point of view': On the nature of anthropological understanding. \" for later work that critiques Geertz's and anthropology's reliance on \"culture,\" see *Writing culture* by Clifford and Marcus. For essays identifying some of the limits of this work, see Deborah Gordon's \"Writing culture, writing feminism: the poetics and politics of experimental ethnography\" and bell hooks' \"Culture to culture: ethnography and cultural studies as critical intervention.\"",
        "One problem is that people aren\u2019t qualified to speak on behalf of their entire \u201cculture,\u201d even if we assume that such a thing exists and can be identified. At best, if you ask these questions, the answers will tell you not about X culture but about what how that person understands and wants to represent X culture. Another problem is that the questions are very abstract and general. Do you think you would be able to give a nuanced and accurate answer to question 4? I don\u2019t think I would!",
        "Well, I think it depends on what you want to know, and from what perspective you are asking the questions. Generally speaking, yeah, they are a little too vague and broad - at least without some follow-up probes and questions. A phenomenological approach is focused on participants' subjective experiences (Billups, 2020). In that case, you are not asking people to represent their entire culture; you're asking them to share their experiences of their culture with you, and using that data to describe people's first-person experiences of living in that culture. Phenomenology is not really an attempt to be generalizable (one could argue that most qualitative research is not, as Seidman (2019) does), so it doesn't matter if people can't speak for their entire culture. They're not expected to. But I mean, how else are you supposed to understand how people think about these topics unless you ask them? Even observation alone isn't enough to understand how people think about and experience their culture. It's not offensive to simply *ask* people how their culture treats gender roles or what their experience of social power is like in their culture. The real issue, I think, is how broad and abstract and frankly *ginormous* these questions are. I think that's not your fault, though, as they were fed to you by a teacher (ew). Typically, the questions in your interview guide are developed based upon what you want to know - some hypothesis you have or a theme you want to explore (Billups, 2020; Seidman, 2019; see also pretty much any other guide on constructing qualitative research). These questions don't seem centered around uncovering specific themes or experiences; they kinda ping pong around. There seems to be a general theme of understanding how power is constructed, but I think if that's the case the questions make a lot of assumptions. I think you should begin by identifying what culture people mean when you say \"your culture\". Most people are members of lots of different cultures. If I were answering this question, my reference culture would be Black American culture, but there's no way that you'd know that from me simply answering the questions. You also need to build some rapport first before you dive into these personal questions - participants are going to give a person they trust a really different answer to most of these than someone they don't trust. (Gender roles and honor/shame can be fraught in many cultures.) I'd also ask about stories and experiences as follow-up probes; those can add richness and depth to the experience of the abstract concepts. If the goal is simply to expose you to different cultural conceptions of gender, power, and honor - these are not terrible, I guess. I could pretty comfortably answer these questions - not comprehensively, of course, but that's not the point. *But* I am also a social scientist who studies these things, lol, and I'm not sure how comfortable the average person would be with answering them.

        "This is still a possible topic of debate in philosophy. Although, there are a few arguments that focus less on whether the mind resides solely in the brain, but rather the brain is the main center in which the mind functions. The argument they put forward points out the fact that we can alter our consciousness by messing with the brain. A few examples given are sleep, anesthesia, and other drugs. I will describe them a little more below: 1) In instances of sleep, especially deep wave sleep (deltawaves found in the third stage), we are not conscious of anything going on. It is a total darkness where our mind is nowhere to be found, although there is altered brain activity to be measured. 2) When we are put under for surgery for example, anesthetics (general, not local) work on different regions of the brain. Under anesthesia, it works like an on/off switch. You are awake and mindful, you suddenly sleep, time passes (which you have no recollection of), and then you awake. In the period of time that the drugs altered your brain, your mind also seemed to be altered (and equally not present during the anesthetics effects). 3) Other drugs (such as stimulants and psychedelics) can alter the brain chemistry and also then change our mindful perceptions. They can do so by mechanism such as hallucinations or even psychosis. We can \u2018lose our mind\u2019 by using brain altering drugs. You can look at the philosophical, cognitive, and neural arguments by parsing through epiphenomenalogical, dualist, functionalist, and eliminative materialist positions! Edit: NREM 3 stage of sleep has high amplitude delta, not theta, waves. This just randomly dawned on me and I had to change it.",

        "For information, there was recent reasonable scoping review of published data here: The authors did not seek to enquire into mechanism or come to any causal explanations. Their conclusion comments only on the frequency, cross-cultural nature of reports and the lack of methodological standards. I am not aware there is a consensus single causal psychological explanation for claimed past life memories (PLMs). Rather, a number of different overlapping mechanisms have been proposed involving some mixture of [false memories], [confabulation], [fantasizing] and [cryptomnesia] together with various [reporting biases] (coincidences being overrepresented, childrens' reports being reported to researchers via the selective [aphophenia] filter of family and also reported much later in time, allowing for selective reinforcement and embellishment). It should be noted that claims for PLMs are not direct evidence for \"past lives\" (reincarnation) in themselves. If, hypothetically, some PLM cases could be verified beyond all reasonable doubt then this would only suggest that some form of memory transfer had occurred by an unknown mechanism. One could still conjecture different biological or other mechanisms to explain this without recourse to reincarnation or non-physical means.",

Seems there is a strong cognitive bias that insists these must not be true.",
        "There's really no good scientific evidence for this. What happens is a kid says something, the grown ups in their life latch onto it and feed into it, and then they go out seeking confirmation bias. If you get the details of these reports they don't always find someone who 100% marches but just matches enough. In a world of 7 billion people and who knows how many dead people, it's really not hard to say something and match it up with someone who is dead. For example, there was a boy once who said his name was Pam and he died in NYC in a fire. In a city like NY, it's really not that hard to find a Pam who died in a fire at some point. There's also an element of counting the hits but ignoring the misses. Kids say whacky stuff. When I was a kid I was convinced that I went to a different dimension when everyone was sleeping. I even would tell people about it. Imagine how different my life would have been if I had people who actually believe me and paved the way for me to double down on it. Kids want to please adults and they pick up on the expectations. They can sense when they are expected to say something."

      "output": [
        "I'm a perception researcher. So let's first define two aspects of experience of stimuli. There is sensation. This is sensory receptors firing (unconscious). Then there is perception. This is the conscious perception of a stimuli. The distinction here is that the sensory system receives information in a way that is \"raw\" and is meaningless. It takes the perceptual system to interpret the signals and create something meaningful. Example. Light signals enter the eye and stimulate the retina. Individual retina stimulation is useless information to us. The brain converts it into an image and experience. Now two processes occur as part of perception.  1. The stimuli reaches awareness and 2. The interpretation of that stimuli is created. The first is called threshold. A stimuli must have a specific level to meet a threshold for awareness. Example a sound out of human range won't cause an audio receptor to fire, likewise, if the sound is too quiet, a receptor will not fire. So the stimuli must be at a sufficient level. But this level can fluctuate based on attention. If you are intensely playing a game, you may not notice someone knocking on the door even though the sound is at a level that is stimulating your audio receptors. As for the interpretation. This is largely what is called \"top down\" processing. Top down refers to cognitive influence. Like experience and expectations, as well as shortcuts (heirestics). These will heavily influence how the sensory information is interpreted. Bottom up refers to the pure raw sensory information . This definitely influences perception but, depending on the quality of the stimuli information, top down may have a bigger impact on perception. When the information is poor (low light, low audible, etc) the brain relies more on guessing based on previous experiences and those heirestics I mentioned before. And to answer a q about emotion. Yes, emotion can influence attention and thus will influence perception. Also the interpretation of complex situations are also influenced by emotions. Hope that gives you a breakdown of how the system works. Let me know if you have any questions."

We aren't there to decide if a story is true, but to help the patient with their emotional process. If the person is coming to therapy to blame, point fingers , not take responsibility, it becomes obvious very quickly. I've worked in jails and people lie all the time. It really doesn't matter. 2. Depending on the the type of work, patterns of lies become very obvious. I work with court mandated offenders and the lies and defenses are really similar . Experience makes it pretty easy (this is different than a stranger coming into your office with a sob story, in which case, back to #1 ). It is really easy to tell when someone is playing the victim because generally victims blame themselves. Trauma survivors talk about what they should have/could have done differently, feel intense guilt and shame. 3. In assessment , the truth does matter a lot more . People still lie . I can't catch everything, but the tools we use are great for helping. I have a few tests I use if I suspect someone is lying and they are very effective. Again, experience comes in. If you know what someone wants it is easier to see what they may lie about. For example , it is pretty obvious to me when someone is faking psychotic symptoms. I have much more experience with psychosis than the person faking it. I have been bamboozled in areas outside my knowledge base . For example, a woman faked a complicated biological condition. I took her word at face value and later learned it was a manipulation."

The circumstances in 2016 were such that he felt he could get the maximum publicity for his business so he actually filed to run, never expecting that he would win. The longer he lasted in the election, the more publicity. That was the goal. No one in the Republican primaries knew what to do with him. He didn't behave in a rational, political way. One by one they all gave up. He was the last man standing. His stunt was working better than he expected. Then the night of the election, lightning struck. His sales pitch was so effective he sold everyone beyond his dreams. Then the nightmare began.",

He is a charismatic guy. charisma doesn't mean nice. That year it happened to be a crowded field. one of the most in years for the Republican primary. His personality helped him stand out and his breaking of Reagan's 11th Commandment caught the Right by surprise. They were unprepared to deal with him. 3. Hillary was a weak candidate; a very conservative and uncharismatic politician. The public was just getting around to understanding how political families are like Dynasties. The *Clintons,* the *Huckabees*, the *McCaines*, etc. The Dem party was most likely prepared to campaign against Romney or other establishment Republican. 4. Trump has no platform. where does he actually stand on abortion, tariffs, or infrastructure? Doesn't matter. He has a catchphrase and then kept changing sides all throughout his first campaign to essentially be \"I'm your guy\" and people loved that. related to it. Make America Great Again? of course not, I want our country to be great! His platform was one you could talk about on an elevator ride but not much longer. and again, the charisma helped him here. 5. You said \"it happened overnight\" but that's not true. he came in last in the first primary and it was a while until he wone. like I said, the Dems were sure it was gonna be Hillary v Romney. The MAGA movement just kept building bit by bit and once he won the Primary, every Republican had to vote for him because of how the parties work. as i said in bullet point 1, the parties work differently. Dems are a coalition party but Reps are all faithful followers to their one message. if you want absolute power, it'll be through that party. 6. Trump got the evangelical vote. Multiple times throughout the campaign he said his favorite book was the bible, and always had it on him. that got him the Evangelical vote, when in reality he's most likely an atheist according to every faith statement he made in the 90s. 7. Trump has \"a look\" you may not think he's handsome, but he looks different than the average politician. that notoriety matters, it's an old advertising trick from Hollywood. Or in the Pick-up Artist world, it's known as Peacocking. 8. He had the best hype men money could buy. And the MEMES. Again, because he won the republican nomination, no registered republican would dare say the memes were stupid because of the 11th commandment. \\*special mention that the Right was already moving towards having an extremist problem. the previous election cycle it had another splinter group called the Tea Party movement, with moderate success, but they were far right religious.

That something is the pre-eminent position in America, where regular white hetero Christians and their norms automatically are the default norms for everyone and everything. Trump's message is \"You are being cheated. I am your retribution. Put me in charge.\" The name political scientist use for this kind of political ideology is revanchism. It's about revenge and taking back what you think is rightfully yours. And the Republican Party is now a revanchist party, not a conservative party (if it ever was that.) Trump doesn't need to be eloquent or articulate. In fact, he's better off not being either of those things because the lack of polish means to his supporters that he's genuine. What he does convey very clearly is a set of emotions, and those emotions are: anger, contempt, impatience, and being aggrieved. These are literally the same feelings that keep people tuning into Fox News and other right-wing media night after night. That linguistic fuzziness also allows people to project onto him their own particular feelings and see in him what they want. That's why some people can believe that he's a good Christian when it's pretty clear he's not religious at all. We live in an age where most people we are exposed to through the media are not actually people. They are carefully crafted representations of people. Politicians are no different. And Trump understands this. That's why he's always dressed the same, always delivers his catchphrases in the same tone, has about three public emotions, etc. I mean, the guy was literally a character on a TV show. If people watch some conventional TV show with a character they like who is constructed like that, how would it fit with the show if it turned out that the character actually had a totally messy personal life and all kinds of ugly problems in his business? The answer is: it wouldn't. It doesn't fit the image that has already been constructed and sold to them, so they ignore all that other stuff. And they know what they see is real because he goes around the country performing the same character at rallies. You can see the realness with your own eyes at those rallies. He operates more like a rock star than a politician in that regard.",
        "Let's ignore his charisma and savvy as a marketer for a minute. In the US for years now we've been told that government is inefficient and useless. We've also constantly heard politicians, especially from one party, promising a return to the good old days if we had less government or better if government was run like a business. That's led some voters to believe that instead of lawyers or even worse professional politicians running the country, it should be run by businessmen. So who better to lead the \"free nation\" than the self proclaimed greatest businessman and negotiator ever. In addition to his dubious business credentials, he entered the race at a time when every other candidate was flat. Let's be honest, the other contenders sucked and that included on the democrat side. He came in with more charisma and more positive name recognition than his rivals on both sides. Beyond that he came in at a time when like it or not a good percent of the population felt vulnerable. Lots of certain people felt they couldn't say, think or do what they used to when things were \"good.\" He really took advantage of that by using their language, condoning their behavior and promising a return to those good old days. The promise of a return to the good old days even if today is better is crack for people who aren't doing well, feel disenfranchised or look around and see others getting new opportunities. Most of us are extremely disconnected. At best we have an echo chamber and at worst we're loners typing on a keyboard hoping for engagement. Most people want to be a part of something bigger and feel like that something bigger will put them in their rightful place. Trump makes that promise for a large number of people. So many people in the US consider themselves patriotic and don't like the direction of the country. So what better group to join than one trying to make America great again? What better leader to get behind than one who says he understands you, is one of you and will restore the order you think is natural? Instead of the usual policy lies he tapped into the hopes and dreams of people who felt forgotten and left behind. People who truly believed they're not the problem. Once he had their attention he then convinced them that he and he alone had the solution they needed. He convinced them that anyone against him is also against them."

        "Dr. Thomas Joiner put forward the Interpersonal theory of suicide. It's pretty straightforward - social isolation and feeling that you're a burden to others result in a desire for death - but it can't really happen or be enacted until or unless you develop the capability for serious self-harm through habituation to painful and fearsome experiences through things like combat, warfare, extensive cutting and self-harm, severe physical trauma, physically or psychologically traumatic experiences, etc. If you get the triad - feelings of burdensomeness, social isolation, and the capability to enact grievous self-harm, you gain the ability to \"override\" self-preservation, and the risk of suicide skyrockets. Dr. Joiner has some great research and extremely interesting lectures on YouTube. Durkheim's book is interesting because it looks at culturally-sanctioned suicide, which isn't really studied anymore. Here are some good papers that I've read on the subject: Joiner, T. (2005). Why People Die by Suicide. Harvard University. Van Orden, K. A., Witte, T. K., Gordon, K. H., Bender, T. W., & Joiner Jr, T. E. (2008). Suicidal desire and the capability for suicide: tests of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior among adults. Journal of consulting and clinical psychology, 76(1), 72. Van Orden, K. A., Witte, T. K., Cukrowicz, K. C., Braithwaite, S. R., Selby, E. A., & Joiner Jr, T. E. (2010). The interpersonal theory of suicide. Psychological review, 117(2), 575.Chicago",
        "There are several theories and Durkheim\u2019s book is very interesting because it evokes 4 different types of situation that can make people want to be able to ignore their self-preservation instinct. When you look up the stats on suicide in many countries, it\u2019s clear that some groups of people are much more at risk. Being in one of these situations isn\u2019t the only thing that plays a role. Theoretically, if a person was making a choice 100% rationally based on their estimation that their life simply needs to stop, it wouldn\u2019t actually be the most complicated plan to put in place. Yet that\u2019s not how it works. We see that some people who seem to have such strong beliefs, even for a long time, overcome suicidal ideation, and go on to live a fulfilling life. A strong belief will not necessarily overwrite instinct on its own. Of course, we know that correlation isn\u2019t always causation, but there are other risk factors. And, happily, some protective factors. We see that some professions, some age groups, \u2026 are more at risk, and usually men are much more at risk, except in some countries and some professions. Also, keep in mind that some types of death, for instance car crashes, aren\u2019t often taken into account because they can\u2019t easily be categorised as suicides or accidents. Stats aren\u2019t perfect representations. It\u2019s likely that desensitisation to violence, self-harm and/or death plays a role. People who work in settings where desensitisation happens are more at risk, such as healthcare workers, military, law enforcement personnel, \u2026 People who have been victims of repeated violent abuse. People who have lived through multiple adverse childhood experiences. Perpetrators of violent crimes are also more at risk. Also, one of the problems with very lethal methods that just require one violent impulsive moment of \u00ab\u00a0not wanting to be here\u00a0\u00bb : these methods are very different from natural causes of death, from which our instincts tend to protect us. It\u2019s a complex subject and there are a lot more studies and analyses. Learning about protective factors is also very interesting."

        "The simplest way I can put it is: being *present.* Are you *really* paying your full, undivided attention, *in each and every moment,* to what the other person is saying or needing, with as much of your focus, and on *all the levels* of which you are capable? I.e. not just their words, but the meaning underneath them or \"between the lines\", the emotional content, *why* they're saying them, their non-verbal communication, what they might want subconsciously, what their emotional state is. Sometimes this might involve simply asking them, or asking more questions at least. Why it's hard is because it takes *effort.* Mental and emotional effort. So many times we just give kinda 'automatic', unaware, *lazy* responses, sometimes even designed to just simply shut the conversation down because we can't really be bothered right now. In fact it's not even the response that is lazy, it's usually the *listening*. *Attunement* is kinda the opposite of this 'automaticness', this mindlessness. It's listening with your heart, *and* your mind, your full attention. I suppose it has some overlap with mindfulness. So an example with attunement (or lack of it) with children is the theory that: mindless praise can be just as damaging as mindless criticism. E.g: \"Yes your painting is lovely darling\" (without so much as even looking up from your phone). The *words* are praising, so surely good parenting right? No because the emotional message is clear, it's neglect - 'I don't really care enough to look, and I even slightly resent being asked to, so I'll give this response in the hope that you won't say any more about it'. It's also *deeply confusing* \\- because the non-verbal message and the verbal message being received simultaneously are so completely opposite. It breeds mistrust from the child. There is a whole separate argument that mindlessly or automatically giving praise can make a child complacent or lazy - 'If everything I do is already 100% wonderful why would I put any more effort in?' Combine this with the insecurity the child feels that the parent isn't really there, isn't paying attention, isn't really *seeing* them, as they are, flaws and all, is maybe seeing some idealised 'little angel', because that takes less effort, and you have a recipe for a wounded, insecure, potentially even narcissistic adult. What they *want* \\- is neither praise nor criticism. Maybe an honest critique, sure. But what a child really wants is for you to *look,* just look, at their painting, and consider it, to be *present* with it, and by extension *with them*. There's an example of this in the book 'The Examined Life' by Stephen Grosz - where the caregiver simply gives a neutral observation with a smile: \"There's a lot of blue in your picture\". They've really *looked* at it, noticed something about it, and shared their observation, which may lead to more conversation - the child may want to talk more about their picture, the colours or the blueness and why they chose them etc. And the adult may, just may, want to take part in that conversation. If they don't, then they at least take the time to explain why they don't/can't right now, or promise to make time for it later. That is, *if* they are attuned enough to consider that the child wants some undivided attention (rather than just empty validation or a pat on the head), and might be feeling disappointed if they can't have it right now."

Other psychologists will use the term more broadly to also include many other disorders in the DSM (mood disorders, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, dissociative disorders, etc). In the context of psychological studies, a \"neurotypical\" participant is one that doesn't have any mental health/neurodevelopment diagnoses or one that doesn't have the particular condition(s) being studied. There isn't one correct list of what \"counts\" as neurodivergent and what doesn't.",

There are so many clinically relevant experiences surrounding autism that are understudied or not studied at all, because non-autistic researchers aren't necessarily sensitive to those things unless they're looking for them. Autistic people have been aware of autistic burnout as a concept for easily 10 years at this point (the earliest use of the term I can find is on an autistic person's blog in 2013).

While it's true that this kind of stuff is incredibly rare it still effects a massive amount of individuals because there just are so so many people in the world. So if one's only understanding of mental illness is mild presentations of common disorders then the people who need the most help end up falling through the cracks or dismissed and that's a huge problem for those people AND the professionals who work with them. I work in an inpatient setting and while something like schizoaffective disorder is very rare in general it makes up roughly 1/3 of our clientele. So, when psychology course work only spends 10min discussing this incredibly rare disorder and dismisses educating people on it or when researchers dismiss this population as being worthy of study every single person involved in their care suffers from a serious lack of accurate information which is detrimental to those clients. I recently had to create a training from scratch about serious mental illness and severe presentations bc even masters level professionals had no legitimate knowledge of how to work with these populations and the people who took that training said they learned more from me in an hour than they did in their entire degree program (about these topics).

The same goes for sex if you're non-asexual.

        "Look up RMT - Recovered-Memory Therapy. It was another movement/idea that rapidly promulgated and was adopted by a large swath of the psychology industry, from academics to practitioners. Instead what it showed was the dangerous and destructive power of suggestive messaging. Instead of identifying true memories, it was encouraging people to create false memories that appeased the directives of the authority figure, the therapists. This was especially dangerous with children, whose false accusations spurred mass panic nationwide. You can take that factual history of psychology and extrapolate it into what is happening today where millions of children are openly claiming that they would be dead if their gender identity wasn't fully affirmed without question. Or where black children are fully convinced that the police are the biggest threat to their lives. Or to people convinced that Jews are literally the source of all evil in the world. Once psychology has proven its coercive powers, it is a matter of time before institutions take on the same tactics. Follow the path of education for the last 50+ years. There are excuses after excuses for the shortcomings of our education system. Yet a system that was once led by actual educators started to be taken over by psychologists. Much of the control of the education system was turned over to psychologists around the 50's, and the academics of teaching degrees also became more focused on the psychology of teaching rather than the academic knowledge that the teacher had in the subject they would be teaching. Yet, as much as we keep trying to blame teacher pay as the sole contributing factor in the failures of teachings in the Western world, education has been in the decline since psychology took center stage over core competencies. Sorry I went in a bit of a rant and conflated two technically separate topics. But I would summarize all that by saying that psychology is dangerous when it takes an idea and treats it like unquestionable scientific fact among the entire industry before having concrete evidence to prove the idea. Affirmation therapy and the approach to pedagogy are two modern day examples. While RMT as well as a host of other historical failures are other examples of how when bad psychology is treated as scientific fact can cause mass harm to society as a whole.",

The bystander effect If someone is assaulted and there are lots of people around, then no one jumps in to help, when you look at the data, the opposite of this is true. The marshmallow test A child is placed in front of 2 marshmallows and told not to eat them then left and observed via video. Many years later, those \"disciplined\" children were more successful. They later found that poor kids often came to the experiment hungry so were more likely to need to eat. If the rich kids were hungry they ate at the same rate. Being rich is a good indicator for later success. The Milgram Experiment It was about following orders. A scientist and the subject are in 1 room and an actor is in the other. The Dr tells them to continue to electrocute them to higher and higher levels. They later said that they knew it was an actor, and also the experiment excluded a high number of people who refused. These form fundamental theories that are the assumptions of many other studies. I think that EEG and better large data observations will help get a more accurate place for breakthroughs. Also, disproving many core studies is also a great opportunity also.",
        "Bit of a nuanced point, but the thing that bothers me a bit is that, when looking at conditions such as ADHD, depression, autism, etc. We diagnose and treat based on symptom rather than cause, which I think can lead to errors in treatment, stigma and understanding. We've essentially created a social construct where we say 'this set of behaviours we're going to call autism' and 'this set of slightly overlapping behaviours we're going to call ADHD', etc. etc. and then we treat those titles as if they're referring to something as fixed and as objective as diabetes/heart disease/etc. My issue with this is that no one is going to fit perfectly into each of these boxes, and there could be myriad causes for certain sets of behaviour patterns so grouping diagnoses based on that can be unhelpful when it comes to treatment, support and understanding. Get why we do it and why it arose like that, the brain be a complicated thing, but I think it's important to bring an understanding of 'these are just labels we've created to make things easier and they are by no means perfect' would be helpful and it's not something I, personally at least, see all that often.",
        "After graduating (2016) I came to realise I miss a gigantic philosophical fundament in the current psychological paradigm. It\u2019s at least half a subconscious/metaphysical field which still is forced into numbers because science always feels the need to express itself in absolute numbers. For example: we teach psychologist (to be) that we can say people are in disorder, which automatically accepts the viewpoint of which we steer people to believe it is healthier to behave in a certain normalised order rather than to be their authentic selves. The mental illnesses of the people reflect, in my opinion, more so a system that is sick and thus not capable of serving us anymore. I think every imaginable disorder lives inside of us, just like every imaginable order does. How could we otherwise recognise it in another? The psychology of people would benefit if we would allow it to move more freely rather than to define it by labels and numbers."

Both works have a different scope but conclude a similar formula for where right wing parties find success; * a lack of (effective) left wing alternative * failure of mainstream parties to address economic concerns across class boundaries * absence of political suppression of radical ideologies * socio-economic anxieties of a world becoming more globalized ( as expressed as xenophobia, protectionism, chauvinism, etc.) Even though these works are about 20 years old, I think their theses still hold true: liberalism, neoliberal economics are struggling to deliver for many people as the world becomes more and more connected, so voters, politicians seek ideas outside of the liberal hegemony. I highly recomend both but Joseph Stiglitz, on top of being one of the great economist of the late 20th century, is a really really good writer. His current writings on American populism and the (lack thereof) economic resiliency in China are very interesting",
        "I'm struck more by the absence of real substance behind the right wing leaders. In the past, especially considering the great models of authoritarian leaders - Alexander, Caesar and Napoleon - one might assume that the leaders would be former soldiers or at least very active in serious revolutionary groups. Instead, it seems like they are lifelong politicians, failed businessmen or professors or even simple celebrities who gain a flash of popularity and ride that to election victories. They often have financial support from oligarchs of some kind and from right wing think tanks - is it because they aren't actually serious people so these backers in the shadows believe they can be more easily controlled for their own interests and ideologies?",

        "There is a bit of a misunderstanding about how evolution works in your question. [Here] is a nice list of common misunderstandings of evolution. If you scroll down you will find these two entries: \u201cNatural selection is about survival of the very fittest individuals in a population\u201d and \u201cAll traits of organisms are adaptations.\u201d So in terms of the first misunderstanding, it\u2019s important to remember that humans are a social species where multiple males and females live together in social groups, and most members produce offspring. So wealth does not automatically lead to more offspring for the wealthy, especially if all or most members of the group get enough calories and nutrition for normal reproduction. And this was likely true for the majority of our history. As an incredibly weak and vulnerable species, we are entirely dependent on the group for survival. And so in small societies we usually find very little hoarding of food and basic resources. There may be inequality in \u201cluxury\u201d items, but it does not benefit anyone for most of the population to be so sick and malnourished that they can not reproduce. In terms of the second misunderstanding, we can not assume that every human behavior or social pattern (past or present) is somehow evolutionarily adaptive. It may be maladaptive or neutral. Human behavior has evolved to allow for maximum flexibility and adaptation, so very few of our specific social behaviors are directly shaped by evolutionary pressure. The working consensus in anthropology is that the average number of children people have in any society is shaped by: the labor needs of the society, food and resource availability, the rate at which infants will reach adulthood, and access to ways of controlling reproduction."

      "output": [
        "In Marxian terminology, capitalism is a set of socioeconomic circumstances (that may be a consciously designed system, or may otherwise arise from the lack of any conscious system to prevent them) that allow private property (capital, AKA equity, AKA the \"means of production,\" e.g. land rights, intellectual property, factory machinery, logistical networks, distribution companies, etc) to be treated as personal property. Though not strictly part of the definition, the invariable corollary of this in practice is that it allows the capital owner to restrict workers' access to that capital and effectively charge them for access to it under the guise of paying them for their labour time. It is *not* synonymous with \"the free market.\" If you can stomach the ponderous 19th century prose, Karl Marx' seminal work [Capital: A Critique of Political Economy] (more commonly known by its shortened German title *Das Kapital*) really does lay it all out pretty darned well, from first principles, in frankly exhaustive detail. EDIT: To be as succinct as possible, boiled down to its most essential definition and without considering moral, ethical or practical socioeconomic corollaries that tend to arise but theoretically might not under specific circumstances or in limiting or degenerate cases, \"capitalism\" *just* means \"personal ownership of capital.\" I think I can reasonably safely say that *all* even half-way meaningful interpretations of the word, whatever else they may vehemently disagree on, must necessarily agree upon that core trait. 2ND EDIT: In fairness, though the vast majority of Marx's analysis is still valid, some may find the \"historicist\" aspects of his reasoning to be rather quaint in light of what we now know of chaos theory, which IIRC wasn't really formally conceptualised at the time he was writing. However, one should not use that as an excuse to outright ignore those parts of his work, let alone invalidate the overall thrust of it; it just means that what 19th century Marxists might have regarded as a kind of \"iron law\" of historical progression, we should probably now view as more akin to a strong statistical trend, i.e. very-likely-but-not-strictly-guaranteed. It'd be an intellectual quibble, not a hard refutation.",
        "\"1) free enterprise and the competitive market, (2) the pursuit of profit and its private appropriation, (3) wage labor and the production of commodities, (4) property rights, (5) the financial infrastructure of money and investment that makes possible credit and debt, (6) a highly variable degree of state regulation, and (7) a propensity for growth as the productive re-investment of profit.\" &#x200B; Like many political words, having a singular definition is just not there. People can often dwell on some technical definition, but most of the time the words carry a greater meaning in common discourse. You'll find people debating what is socialism, fascism, capitalism... &#x200B; I'm generally of the view that debating the words is not too productive. What we want is to actually communicate and have a common idea of what the words mean.In that spirit, I'm going to give a few terms along 'capitalism' and give you the the key points of the words. Before I would engage with anyone (Even in real life), I like to establish what they want the terms to mean. It just makes talking to people easier. Don't like these use, give me others and it's all good. But I've had pretty good luck with these. Free-Market - focuses mainly on the voluntary exchange of goods and services. The more free the market, the more the individual gets to dictate what they 'buy/sell' and how much they 'spend/sell' on it. Your basic 'barter' economy is probably the purest example here. I give you 10 chickens and you give me 1 cow. &#x200B; Capitalism - Focuses on the greater system of investing (financial markets). Banks, stock market, debt. We also need 'growth' to keep the system going. Also I'd say the 'greater' powers are often private interests as opposed to government. &#x200B; Mercantilism - Focuses on the fusion of government and industry; for the benefit of the country. For example, I'd say China is a very Mercantile economy today. Power is shared between the government and very large private interests. Historically, a lot of colonial powers worked like this, like say the British/Dutch East India company. &#x200B; These are all on a spectrum and are mixed together in any society.",
        "There are many different definitions of Capitalism. Many of these definitions contradict one another. Some people emphasize the fact that money is involved, and therefore argue slavery is the ultimate form of Capitalism. Others argue that Capitalism is about using money to make things that make you more money, and therefore the Soviet Union\u2019s insistence economic growth is a form of Capitalism. For most economists historically neither of these are Capitalism, because the core of Capitalism is individuals working for themselves. The IMF [definition], for example, quotes Adam Smith as saying that \u201cit is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we get our dinner, but their regard for their own interest.\u201d Enslaved persons work for their masters interest, not their own; and under the Soviets everyone worked as part of a plan. They are not working for their own interest. Due to the contradictory definitions many Social Scientists avoid using the term. Economists will frequently talk about \u201cMarket systems,\u201d for example.",
        "Part of the problem, as you may have discerned from this thread, is that capitalism tends to be defined either by its Marxist enemies (who have a vested interest in making it look bad) or its enthusiastic neoliberal supporters (who have a vested interest in making it look good). Like \u201csocialism,\u201d it may just not be a useful word. The SEP\u2019s [conceptual delineation] section on its page about markets kind of illustrates this problem, as it describes three market systems, two of them proposed as alternatives to capitalism, that would all generally be characterized as capitalist based on popular discourse. In other words, your confusion is an accurate and perceptive assessment of the word\u2019s ambiguity.",
        "Adam Smith covers it as well as anybody. If you want a TL;DR though, It's basically using what skills, knowledge or advantages you have to aquire resources and then usng those resources to obtain MORE resources, and just keeping the ball rolling.  If you have an apple tree, you sell the apples you don't want to eat yourself, and instead of buying other things you might want or need, you use the money to buy more apple trees. Then you sell the apples from those trees to buy more land, plant more apple trees, maybe branch out into cider making or apple pie making, use those \"profits\" to buy more and more land, aand hire others to take your apples and cider into towns and sell them, and use THOSE profits to increase your apple growing efficiency so you can cut prices, undercut the prices of the pear and plum guys, hire away their best workers and eventually create an apple empire!!! Basically, that's it. You own and control the means of apple production and use that ownership to increase your productivity in competition with others to meet a need. You can also bribe officials to pass laws ensuring you can compete more effectively, buy up struggling competitiors and pay starvation wages to displaced migrants to do your work, but that's more optional. not really part of the main thing"

        "I am also a psych major but not a psychologist. Consider for a second that someone who is a sociopath, now generally called antisocial personality disorder, by very definition acts in an antagonist way to society and those around them. Key to this mental disorder is that they simply don't care that they behave this way, as long as this does not stop them from getting what they ultimately want. They are not necessarily indifferent to people. In fact, people are a useful, abusable means to an end. If you have no qualms about harming others for personal gain (see \"dark triad\") then that's ASPD. If you are simply disinterested in interacting with others, that falls more under cluster A personality disorders, like schizoid (as another redditor mentioned). If you don't exhibit any peculiar, I.e. eccentric behaviors, you just might be on the more asocial side of the social continuum which we all belong. The key qualifier of having vs. Not having a mental disorder is if it is maladaptive with regards to yourself and/or those around you. The most mild and perhaps most likely explanation is that you're introverted. Introverts, as some people define, are people drained by social interaction and energized by social withdrawal. That could be what is going on. Discuss with a psychologist for a diagnosis, speak to a therapist and/psychiatrist for treatment. Best wishes"

All these theories are empirically tested with the scientific method. Evidence from different type of empirical studies, with different levels of analysis helps us evaluate the veracity of these theories. There are mechanisms that have been \u201cproven\u201d robust, such as learning, certain cognitive processes, and traits. However, even these concepts can\u2019t explain everything. Nonetheless, there are attempts at creating, for example, big theories that organize psychological disorders. Theories like HiTOP or the more biological RDoC. So far none of these attempts are without criticisms. In the mid 20th century psychologists like Freud, Jung used clinical case studies, clinical work and interoception to come up with their theories of personality. They might have been very influential (and are clearly still influential) they are not what we consider and mean by contemporary psychologists. Psychology as a science uses the scientific method. They didn\u2019t care about the scientific method. Modern psychology understands that you can\u2019t just assume mechanisms and that you have to test them first. This is painstaking and slow process. We use self-raport questionnaires, imaging studies, randomized control trials, meta-analysis, and so on. Just as importantly, we use statistics to asses if we can accept or reject our hypotheses. The results are then evaluated on reliability and ultimately validity & veracity. This is very different from the before mentioned psychologists like Freud.

There are ways that you can try to get around this to find the \"effect\" of race (I say \"effect\" in quotes because actually establishing causality is another, trickier question, but sometimes we talk about statistical association between two things as \"effect\"). My background is in political science, so less focused on things like wealth and medical outcomes, and more on outcomes like political participation and party preference. However, these kinds of studies regularly consider the kind of question you're asking. Hopefully this can give you a sense of some of the approaches that might be used, if you want to look into their use in specific contexts like wealth/medical outcomes. Income is frequently used as a statistical control when looking at whether race affects other variables, and vice versa. In individual-level studies, you can look at whether outcomes vary even when income is held constant. More directly, people do examine whether socioeconomic differences within a group impact other variables. An example is [Gay 2004], who looked at whether Black citizens in richer or poorer neighborhoods also had different levels of \"linked fate\" (a sociopolitical attitude where you believe outcomes for yourself are tied to outcomes for your group as a whole). Another way of trying to get at this is with audit studies, which test how people and institutions respond to individuals when factors like education are kept constant, while perceived race/ethnicity is varied (for instance, by providing identical resumes where just the name is varied between stereotypically Black names and stereotypically White or less-coded names, to see if Black-coded job applicants get fewer responses). [Gaddis 2017] has a review of some of these studies, and discusses some of the potential problems with them (e.g. that names are not perfectly correlated with race, and that names can also be coded as having low or high socioeconomic status). I haven't dealt with this field of research extensively enough to know how well those challenges have been addressed."

It is a very widely mistaken belief that sociopath and psychopath are psychological terms, but someone who is teaching the subject should definitely know better. Here's a case where the plaintiff attempted to use his diagnosis of ASPD as a plea for mental incompetence (Note, ASPD does not make someone incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions):  To put this into perspective, Jeffrey Dahmer was diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder, a psychological term. However, he would definitely have crossed the line into what you would call a psychopath. Plenty of people have antisocial personality disorder and are generally peaceful and law abiding, but may have more outwardly self-centered traits. These are the people you would probably label as sociopathic. Again, though, how would you identify someone like that? Good luck!"

        "This seems more of an ethics question than a social science question. I think the question of \"why some people say respect has to be gained and why some do not\" is indeed a social science question, but probably not one that has been extensively researched or paid attention to by social scientists. Which makes giving an answer with citations (see Rule 1) a little difficult. That said the answer to your question essentially lies in Stephen L. Darwall's 1977 article titled [\"Two Kinds of Respect\"]. (Non-paywalled version [here] You can also read a more detailed discussion in Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy's [entry] on respect. The gist is that whenever we talk about \"respect\" there are usually two types of respect: *recognition* respect and *appraisal* respect. It's easy to mix up the two. Appraisal respect needs to be earned, but recognition respect is owed as long as you recognize some facts (e.g. that she is a human being). **Recognition respect** is respect that is owed to a person (object too but that's not relevant to your question) because we recognize some facts about that person. For example, at the lowest level we can recognize that a human being is not an ape or a dolphin and therefore is owed some respect that is not owed to animals; or that we recognize that they are beings with feelings and that we can't treat them like worthless garbage. This type of respect binds us to some regulations of behavior and forms the basis of our laws. This also applies to some people with special societal status (e.g. calling a teacher 'sir', calling a judge 'Your Honor'). **Appraisal respect** is respect that's owed because of some qualitative standards, or excellence, achieved by people. This is the kind of respect that's \"earned\" because someone won a prize, did something of exceptional moral character, achieved an extraordinary feat, etc. So the question here is, when people say \"respect is earned\", are they talking about recognition or appraisal? If it's appraisal, then they are right in saying that it's earned. Recognition respect is not \"earned\", per se, but the obligations to which someone is owed by virtue of being \"a human trying to live their life\" can be a subject for debate. Surely we must adhere to some basic respect for humans such as not treating fellow humans as trash, animals, or food. And some philosophers will say that that's basically what we owe each other. You can disagree but that's pretty much the answer -- recognition respect is by nature not a very high bar.",
        "Honestly, I think a lot of people misunderstand that \"respect\" for you is not the same a \"respect\" for me. Further, if people are going to misuse \"respect\" (and they do, give me a second here), then people are going to tell you to earn the thing you call \"respect\". A lot of people these days say that you should just do a thing because \"it's just the respectful thing to do\". The problem is, I do not believe that thing shows me the proper respect for my point of view. For instance, I am a vegetarian. If I went to a friend's house for dinner, and they served steak, and they demand I eat it because that would be \"respectful\", would it really be respectful? My friend has already shown me disrespect by expecting me to eat something I do not want to. To both of my points above: respect should be agreed upon, and anything else that doesn't fall into the venn diagram of what you call respect versus what I call respect is not just a courtesy, you have to prove that the \"respect\" you're asking for is in my best interest to give you. More to the point, you can't just cover demanding I do what you want me to do *when I don't want to do it* by saying \"it's respectful\". It's a false moral high ground, and it doesn't win you respect of any kind.",

        "You could call this a few different things, depending upon the construct. The first thing that comes to mind is \"psychological inflexibility,\" in which a person maintains certain thoughts (and sometimes behaviors by extension) regardless of their actual circumstances. It's a big part of what is targeted in treatments like DBT and ACT. You might call it \"obstinance\" or \"rigidity\" as well. I'll second u/KookyPlasticHead on \"belief perseverance\" as well. Confirmation bias is related, but I'd call it distinct. I'd define it as treating information as more legitimate or salient because it aligns with views you already hold or want to maintain, while discarding information that might disconfirm that belief. It usually involves only seeking out evidence that reinforces what you believe and failing to even look for evidence that would disprove your hypothesis. Cognitive dissonance can occur when you are faced with evidence that does not mesh with your understanding of the world. Usually, it has to do with believing two contradictory things at the same time, and usually extends to espousing certain beliefs when you know that they are incomplete or untrue. I would say it's different from belief perseverance or confirmation bias, though, because it's less about outright rejection of disconfirming evidence. It's more about dealing with the ambivalence you face when you are trying to decide between two contradictory but compelling viewpoints. There is more internal conflict involved in cognitive dissonance, while these other concepts are more about ignoring new evidence or discrediting it before even beginning to consider whether it might be legitimate. As for your last question, it depends upon what you mean by a \"real concept.\" I'd say it's a phenomenon that can be observed, especially when it comes to deeply held political or social views, but the jury is out about why it occurs. The predominant theory seems to be that the sensation of questioning deeply held beliefs is really unpleasant. In behaviorist terms, it is an aversive stimulus that is presented whenever you are confronted with evidence that draws your opinions into question. That punishes the behavior, so you are less likely to engage in it in the future. The behavior of seeking out or attending to new, disconfirming information undergoes \"extinction,\" which leads people to restrict their media diet and social circle to environments that entrench the beliefs they already hold."

This means blaming anyone except for the perpetrator: yourself, others who you believe to be at fault but not fully blaming the perpetrator. Most therapy modalities are aimed at decreasing self and other blame; and increasing blame for the perpetrator, who actually has intention and is at fault for the outcome.

You have a part of the picture; they have a part of the picture. If you can listen well and explain well, you'll both have a bigger picture. Ask a lot of open-ended questions. Not loaded questions. Respectful curiosity. A fair, sincere question has nothing in it for them to disagree with--it just helps you understand them and their thinking. \"When you say \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, can you tell me what you mean by that?\" \"How did you come around to that way of thinking?\" \"Have you ever considered...?\" \"One thing I've learned, that has been helpful for some people who're going through something similar...\" If you want to get more specific, in-depth training, look into L.E.A.P. communication. It takes some time to get good at, but has turned out to be very useful for many clinicians. Remember that no matter how big a sample size the evidence underlying your beliefs are based on, *in clinical practice n = 1*. Get obsessed with understanding all the facets that make this person's situation unique. Usually they'll appreciate it, and it will make them more receptive to input you offer thereafter.",

Part of your task as professional is to guide your patients into the reliable ones. You must not have too much problem in debunking spam. About pseudoscience, that also include religious-like believes, it's not so easy to debunk, but if it's not pushing the patient far from medicine, i don't worry about it.

Finally there are some diseases that part of the disease is precisely to have defective reasoning -schizophrenia for example-. There that a patient explains that feels a lot better by doing ABC or taking whatever natural product or OTC drug -when science known positively that ABC or that substance have zero effects- is just a good monitoring of how the disease is evolving, and that the patient communication is working fine.

      "output": [
        "Why do you say it\u2019s elusive? It\u2019s a subtype of mental health problems that some therapists may specialize in, like how some therapists are best at treating eating disorders, substance use disorders, trauma, problems related to autism or traumatic head injuries, phobias, complicated grief, etc. Like those problems, some therapists may turn away a person with that disorder if they don\u2019t have a lot of experience treating it. That said, OCD is one of the more common mental health disorders so it would be surprising to see a therapist who doesn\u2019t have any experience with it. OCD used to be classified as an \u201cAnxiety disorder\u201d but as of the DSM 5 it has been moved into a category called \u201cObsessive compulsive and related disorders\u201d which includes things like hoarding disorder and body focused compulsive behaviors. Many people find treatments for anxiety help their OCD symptoms since those symptoms tend to flare up when they are anxious. But there are some therapy modalities specific to OCD like exposure therapy (ERP). CBT can also be effective and trauma therapy if the person attributes the start of their OCD to a traumatic event. A lot of therapy modalities are effective for multiple disorders, so even when a modality is originally designed for one specific situation (like EMDR for PTSD, or DBT for BPD), they often branch out quickly into treating other disorders if they seem effective.",
        "Therapy isn\u2019t as readily available for OCD because of misconceptions and a lack of training surrounding exposure therapy: Many practitioners aren\u2019t trained in ERP, they believe it can be harmful, unethical, too time consuming, or that other forms of treatment can be equally effective. There are also many ineffective treatments out there. Because of this, there aren\u2019t many practitioners who do this treatment. You can find them at IOCDF.org Adaa.org ABCT.org But many don\u2019t take insurance or charge quite a lot. OCD is classified as an OCRD\u2014an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. It\u2019s been moved out of the anxiety disorders chapter. This has nothing to do with treatment. Some like it and some don\u2019t. Here\u2019s an example of an expert in OCD who doesn\u2019t like it: But ultimately, the DSM offers pretty arbitrary classifications anyway. It\u2019s only about clinical utility, so I don\u2019t see any reason to get worked up over diagnoses.",
        "There is quite a bit of research that OCD is \"missed\" a lot, especially in kids. Many people unfortunately are trained to only look for classic OCD presentations like contamination concerns, but miss other still common, but less well known, types of OCD, for example, \"just not right\" obsessions. It is too bad, because exposure response prevention is pretty easy to be trained in and if you know how to treat social anxiety or specific phobias, it isn't too hard to learn to apply to OCD. Other commenters are right though, many parts of the USA at least, simply don't have almost any specialty care outsides of a couple wealth suburbs."

I would also assume that there is more individual variation in PDs in general. While there are patterns to PD dysfunction, it is not quite as clear cut as in autism, I base this on PDs generally having a larger amount of diagnostic criteria and autism having a few central points."

      "output": [
        "Most people exhibit different behavior while dating VS while in a relationship. In men, it is at least partly due to socialization that men are taught to avoid self-reflection, internal emotional navigation, and care work throughout their lives. Unresolved emotions, developmental issues, and dysfuntional dynamics can pop up later in long term relationships and cause problems including but not limited to dysfunction, unequal treatment, withdrawal, abuse, abandonment, and murder. &#x200B; 1. Boys appear to be socialized to be silent about their emotions (alexithymia); this resonates into adulthood: [DeAngelis (2001) noted that by age two, boys are typically less verbally expressive compared to girls. Perhaps due to socialization, boys are less facially expressive by the age of four, compared with same-aged girls.] 2. Men resist getting care: [men of all ages and ethnicities are less likely than women to seek help for all sorts of problems--including depression, substance abuse and stressful life events--even though they encounter those problems at the same or greater rates as women. In a 1993 study published in Psychotherapy (Vol. 30, No. 4, pages 546-553), for example, psychologist John Vessey, PhD, reviewed several epidemiologic surveys and found that a full two-thirds of mental health outpatient visits were made by women. This inability, reluctance or straight-up unwillingness to get help can harm men's own mental and physical health, and can make life more difficult for their friends and families, says Berger.] ALSO [Men will do Almost Anything to Avoid Going to the Doctor] 3. Women generally focus on their relationships' health; men do not: [On the Areas of Change Questionnaire, women, compared with men, wanted greater increases in their partners\u2019 emotional and companionate behaviors, instrumental support, and parenting involvement; men wanted greater increases in sex.] 4. Men often are socialized to believe that Second Shift work is only for women to do; in all households men do less unpaid work and women are just expected to take up the slack without complaining: [In the United States, the traditional conception of the household division of labor defines women as primarily responsible for care of children and the household, while men assume the role of financial provider for the family. However, the dramatic increase in women's labor force participation in the past fifty years has led to changing attitudes about work and family, and blurring of traditional gender roles.] 5. And before people start blaming women for choosing \"bad\" men: Nobody would willingly have a child with a murderer. And yet since homicide is the leading cause of death for women under 45 (EDIT: pregnant/postpartum women under 45), therefore men change during relationships. Being abused, abandoned, or murdered is not women's fault: [Homicide is a leading cause of death during pregnancy and the postpartum period in the United States. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of elevated risk for homicide among all females of reproductive age.] &#x200B; [Father abandonment is a large issue]. Since many men will not listen to their partners asking for them to improve and help out, will not seek therapy, but will be enticed by the prospect of a \"better\" dating experience down the road, I don't see it getting better any time soon. That may be coming to an end, though, women appear to be less willing to entertain subpar men or date at all: [more women are single (and childfree, and healthier) than ever before], and [men who look for the \"better\" dating experiences seem to be having trouble] finding single women willing to date them. It appears that women have got the clue about how marriage, pregnancy, and parenting can be very difficult for them, how they'll be blamed for all of the failures, and now women are choosing to not participate. It seems to be a rational choice in the existing socioeconomic landscape. &#x200B; 1. 2. ALSO 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

        "It is true that children in the United States are much more likely to live in single parent households than in other countries in the world, including other Western countries, namely 23%, while 67% live in two parent households and 8% with extended family [(Pew, 2019).] The vast majority of US single parent households have a mother rather than a father [(Census bureau, 2023)], though the balance has shifted from approximately 10:1 mother to father ratio in 1970 to 5:1 since the 2000s [(Korhonen, 2023)]. The question asked is about child abandonment, but this assumes that: A) the parents had planned to have a child together, which is not always the case, especially for people under 30 years of age [(Sawhill, 2022)], and that pregnancy termination was not deemed to be an appropriate option, B) the parents were planning to have a long term relationship, including marriage or cohabitation. This is not always the case either. Edin & Kefalas argue that some single mothers do not wish to marry the father of their child, because they do not see him as a source of economic security or stability [(Gogoi, 2023)]. Nowadays the US has lower marriage rates and higher divorce rates than in the past. But it is especially an education divide: children living with a non-college educated single mother was 60% in 2020, but 83% in 1980 [(Kearney, 2023)]. It seems that wage stagnation for non-college educated men since the 1980s is a major factor in this. One irony seems to be that the US, compared to other countries, expects high levels of child support payments by the non-custodial parent, which also leads many to be unable/unwilling to provide this level of support, which is an important problem in that the custodial parents do not get as much as they have been awarded by the court [(Sawhill, 2022)]. I haven't been able to fully answer your question by looking into the literature, as I understand abandonment as a wilful and calculated choice by the father to be completely uninvolved with his child(ren), rather than as a result of other factors or choices by others, like the mother of the child wanting (or not) his involvement. However, it seems that these fathers are more 'dead broke than deadbeat' fathers, which causes financial stress in and eventual breakdown of the parents' relationship [(Yorks, 2022)]. Interesting though is that there are different patterns and degrees to which fathers are absent/involved with their child's lives, meaning that it is not always a binary of complete absence or involvement [(Yorks, 2022)].",
        "I don't have kids. Don't want any. So, this is just an outsiders perspective of other men I know. I think most men don't feel like there is anything in it for them. Most of the break-ups I've seen happy early on. Men usually don't get shit in terms of visitation anyway, especially when the kids are young. One weekend a month? Why bother? But I also see so many women shit-talking the dads as the biggest piece of shit that ever lived. They talk this way in front of their kids, and they pick up on it. And so it becomes \"oh, it's my weekend to go see the asshole\". Honestly, who even wants to be around that? If you're kids are going to end up hating you, then what's the point? Let them hate you while they stay with their mom."

The second part can be answered with some primary articles, but we'd need to first know what the condition is. Stress is known to affect decision-making (see [1] , [2], [3], and [4] for example). And that's assuming the person doesn't have co-morbid physical/mental illnesses as well.

The therapist answer is probably something like there\u2019s a huge variety in sex drives across humans, you should not be ashamed about the frequency you masturbate since there is no \u201coptimal\u201d frequency, and masturbation frequency is only a \u201cproblem\u201d if it starts affecting other areas of your life in ways you don\u2019t like. Here\u2019s an article with some averages out of the Kinsey Institute at IU, but numbers like this are fraught which I\u2019ll get into below: You are not going to get a discrete answer in terms of historical research, and the real answer to masturbation frequency almost immediately devolves into a discussion of the politics of knowledge and methodological discussions. Was this considered an appropriate area of research at that time? Which writings have been saved? Who was even willing to write about masturbation historically? Who would participate as a subject in that research at that time? The fact that you are even thinking about masturbation in terms of something to be optimized speaks to the social context and time period in which you were raised. In any area of social science research that focuses on stigmatized behavior (sex and masturbation absolutely included) good data is hard to come by, and understanding the context the data was collected immediately becomes as important as the data itself. For example, measures of rates of sexual orientation vary tremendously based on whether you ask about identity, attraction, or past behavior. My favorite example I saw recently of how limited sexualities knowledge can be with stigmatized sexual behavior was an article in the journal Sexualities (which I am fond of) studying the experiences of women with female ejaculation. Many women don\u2019t know if it is real or even exists, many women are ashamed to even talk about it, and the idea that we can get an accurate count of incidence (or that an accurate count of incidence is representative of something meaningful anyways) is kind of a stretch. You need context. Anyways, as a person, unless the frequency you masturbate affects other aspects of your life in some negative way, it probably isn\u2019t something you need to stress over or optimize."

Identity politics were also very much a thing long before WW2, for example in the racist minstrel shows that were ([and still are, in some ways] very popular in the post-Civil War USA. Source: [The early chapters of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States]. The concept of race itself extends back to Spain at the end of the Reconquista, as the feudal ruling class was forced to find a new way of dispossessing Jewish and Muslim conversos of their property\u2014an inherent quality that could not be changed, that went far deeper than a universalist concept like Catholicism (which is ideally for everyone). If people converted to Catholicism, you weren't allowed to take their stuff, but if you then invented a deeper concept like race\u2014if you said that you were a \"blueblood,\" and that the conversos were still crypto-Jews or crypto-Muslims\u2014you had all the justification you needed to take their stuff. This is the ultimate cause of genocides all over the world (the Holocaust, the Nakba, Native Americans being genocided, etc.). Before this point, systematic racism did not exist. The most important concepts for people around the world tended to be identities like religion, age, gender, tribe, etc. Source: [The early chapters of Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram Kendi.] As for other socially constructed identities, like class, gender, sexual orientation, etc., these are created by exploitative modes of production (slavery, feudalism, capitalism) and, so far as we know, did not exist during the hundreds of thousands of years humans spent running around in the wilderness without even conceiving of the concept of private property (this mode of production is known as ur-communism, and, if anything is human nature, it's probably this).

        "Psychology should nowadays be regarded as part of the broader spectrum of cognitive neuroscience. A lot of the research that goes on in psychology depts would be better described as cognitive neuroscience. Many psychology depts have neuroimaging centres attached. Psychology students are taught scientific methods. It is a scientific discipline. Hence it seeks to understand any and all relevant topics for which measures can be made, hypotheses formulated and experiments performed. Sometimes these may cross over into domains that were traditionally studied under different headings. For example, economics now has crossover subdisciplines of behavioural economics and neuroeconomics. And philosophers get agitated when researchers do experiments to start teasing out answers to questions of autonomous agency (free will) and self-awareness (or other attributes of consciousness). In the end no questions are \"meant\" to be answered by any one discipline.",

Where you use logical thinking and generally language to get to a conclusion. 2. Then there is empirical science. Where you form a hypothesis and test if your data supports the hypothesis or not. 3. There is also mathematical science where you can find proof that things are the way they are. All of these can be applied to many different fields. One of wich is Psychology. Psychology is not 100% tied to a specific method even though it is the poster child of empirical science.",
        "These may all be answered philosophically. However, psychological science aims to answer specific questions. For example, on average what score on this or that optimism scale does one need to predict a certain behavioral outcome. It doesn't make qualitative claims of what a desired level of optimism is, unless there is a specific hypothesis or question related to it. The amount or levels of these constructs are all relative to contextual factors. Even overarching universal theories can be tested empirically. The answers it provides may not always be very satisfying, but science is a slow incremental process."

      "output": [
        "Oof, that's a tricky one. Ideally, your therapist would be explaining this better and helping you through the process. If you're finding that your therapist isn't helpful to you (and you have the opportunity), you might consider changing therapists. This is going to be pretty long, so **tl;dr: Make sure you're engaging in activities that are important to you and feel positive, and have some helpful thoughts prepared in advance for times of negativity.** \"Creating a mental shield\" isn't a term I use with my clients, but there are some things I do talk about that seem like they're probably equivalent. I'll give you the broad ideas, since I don't know much about your situation, but like I said, your therapist should be helping you to adapt these ideas to your own life. The first \"mental shield\" you're going to want to create is resilience. This is basically the notion of having enough good stuff going on in your life that when bad shit happens, it doesn't matter as much. I think of it like a bank account-- if you've got a lot of money in the bank, then a five dollar surcharge or whatever doesn't mean much to you. If you're down to your last ten bucks, every little ding feels like a potential disaster. So resilience is about putting more deposits into your emotional bank account so the withdrawals don't hurt so much. Resilience (again, broad strokes) can come from a couple of different places, but the big ones are having goals that matter to you and making progress toward them, and from engaging in positive, good activities. Think about your major goals-- do you want a high-paying job? Do you want to create great works of art? Travel and see the world? Whatever your goals are, start to think of the ways you can be moving toward those goals now. Even if they're very distant and will take a lot of steps, probably there are things you could be doing today that will get you a little bit closer. Taking these steps and being conscious of the way that they are helping you toward your larger goal helps to build the buffer that is resilience. Positive, good activities (not redundant, I mean different things by positive and good) are activities that you can actively pursue that bring positive emotion into your life. They are distinct from just avoiding unpleasant activities. They include: * Pleasurable activities-- things that are good just because they feel good. Good food, good sex, time with friends, anything that makes you laugh, a good book, a hot bath, whatever. TV and video games can qualify, but only if you're actually enjoying them. Those times that you just switch on netflix and veg out on shows you don't actually give a fuck about for hours on end don't qualify. Basic guideline: if it's something you can look back on a week later and say \"Yeah, that was really good, I'm glad I did that,\" then it qualifies. * Accomplishment activities-- times that you do something that actually makes a difference in the world or in your life. Again, chores or stuff you don't care about doesn't really count. Create something, change something, learn something, teach something. Something that makes a notable difference in the world, for the better. * Values-driven activities-- everybody's values are different, and finding yours out is going to be important. What, at your very core, do you think makes for a life well-lived? What qualities do you want to be remembered for? Intelligence and knowledge? Contribution to your community? Being a good friend? Any activity that expresses your core values helps to build resilience, even if it isn't always enjoyable or doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment. If you're making progress toward your goals and engaging in positive, good activities on a regular basis, you will build that buffer that holds out negativity. That's resilience, and it's one part of a good \"mental shield.\" The other part is more cognitive-- centered around thoughts. The thoughts we have automatically when we're confronted with negativity tend to be painful and to reinforce that negativity. After a conflict with your dad, you might be stuck on thoughts about what a jerk he is, or how he's right and you're a screw-up, or both (I don't know if that's the shit that you're talking about, I just took a guess--obviously your own therapist will be better able to understand the specifics of what you're struggling with). Knowing that your automatic thoughts will be unhelpful, it's a good idea to have a better set of thoughts prepared in advance that will be helpful, balanced and true. You can use these to soften or push out the automatic thoughts. The kind of thoughts you might want to cultivate are things like \"Nobody's perfect, but I'm getting better,\" or \"My dad is just one person, and the way he sees things isn't the only way.\" Obviously, working with your therapist to come up with the specific thoughts that will be most useful to you is better than just taking random guesses from a stranger on the internet. Once you have these thoughts, you can write them down or practice them, so you'll have an easier time remembering them when you need to. Having this kind of useful thought loaded and ready to go is the other part of the \"mental shield.\" At least, that's how I would define it."

        "One of the more valid and reliable ways to measure this objectively is through a method called FACS. Lots of research uses this method. We can't interpret what emotion someone has based purely on face movements. Mostly because emotions are not objectively classified. And how people describe them is highly dependent on language and culture. People also use similar facial changes for multiple expressions with subtle differences. However, you can objectively measure facial movements and compare them in research and make some predictions for shared emotions. A woman at my university is studying facial changes while watching a puppet show. She can determine if most people are experiencing a change in emotion or heightened emotion at specific points by measuring facial changes. She uses the FACS system."

        "The character of capitalism post WW2 was very different from earlier in history, and from today. The destruction of capital stock, and labour shortages following the war, led to workers having a lot of bargaining power, higher wages, and more comfortable lives in the decades after the war. In France they call this period As the world recovered from the war, the proportion of all income earned in the economy that was earned by owning capital increased. Because of this, a smaller proportion of overall income earned was earned from labour, and this led to increased income inequality. If you\u2019d like to read a better sourced version of this, look for \u201ccapital in the 21st century\u201d by Thomas Piketty.",
        "You (and a concerning number of responses in this thread) have got your causality backwards. Single-income families are a sign of low prosperity. People stay home to do menial household labor when their earning potential on the job market is not enough to cover the cost of paying for technology that obviates that labor. Through a combination of social (discrimination against women in education & the workforce) and technological (labor-saving devices being invented and becoming cheaper over time) factors, it has become more common for women to be able to command salaries high enough that the opportunity cost of staying at home became unacceptable to most. See EDIT: for a more focused look at the subject, see this article by once and future mod /u/besttrousers",
        "\"Capitalism\" is a terrible term to use in any social scientific context because it's got so many definitions that are so incredibly contradictory. You will inevitably end up in a debate in which everyone is arguing angrily without actually disagreeing on anything more substantive than the definition of Capitalism. For example the economists typically argue Capitalism didn't start until Adam Smith's time in the late 1700s, which means that slavery was a thing Capitalism inherited from previous eras like feudalism or mercantilism. Numerous other fields consider slavery to be part of Capitalism, and argue that it is inherent to Capitalism. Ergo when you start talking about \"Capitalism\" you are almost certainly going to say something that goes against everything at least one Social Science teaches. Which means you will have an entire pack of PhDs calling you stupid, basing their argument on numerous well-done academic work, etc. As for your question: I have been spending time with economists lately, so I will give the economists answer: People's expectations changed. Income is up [quite a bit since 1960], so people are clearly making moremoney. The costs they complain about tend to be costs that are directly tied to wages (ie: a heart doctor could only see X patients in 1960, if he can only see X patients in 2024 medical costs will have increased at the same rate as wages). So let's look at an actual example. My maternal grandfather was a top patent attorney in Detroit. His four children, wife, and mother-in-law lived in a house that had a single bathroom. They had approximately 300 sq ft. a person. If you spend $250k for a house in that neighborhood today you're wasting at least half the money, because it's not a $250k neighborhood. He had one car. The children attended public schools. Child care was grandma and her my grat-granma. The vast array of monthly bills people pay today (Netflix, Prime, cable, cable internet, cell phone, etc.) simply did not exist. \"Eating out\" wasn't a thing very often, even on Monday when grandma spent the entire day reading the Sunday New York Times and had to scramble like a madwoman to produce something edible before granpa got home. My mom was the baby, and everyone thought she was spoiled because she got ballet lessons and grandpa took her to every ballet recital she wanted. Today you could do all of that on Amazon salary of $15 an hour. One car. Three adults, one of whom receives social security. Four kids, but no child-care expenses. A couple monthly bills (electricity, heat, mortgage, landline). Car is an old Corolla. Education is Detroit Public Schools. Medical care is Medicaid. Your biggest problem is likely to be auto insurance, which was always shockingly high when I lived in Detroit (this is 2010ish). This method is precisely how religiously conservative groups, with low education levels, manage to raise big families. So the difference is that we simply expect more. Great-grandma needs her own house and her own space. The situation on Marseilles Ave., where Aunt Chris was exiled to great-granma's room after excessive sister-torture of Aunt Liz, would not be acceptable. If you're doctorate-level and you have your kids in a Detroit neighborhood it had better be one of the $600k-house ones or people think you don't love your kids. Nobody's going to a Detroit Public School if it isn't a magnet school. Child care has to come from someone you pay money, who is highly educated.",
        "It's the pointlessness of overly competitive culture. Everyone working as hard as they can, barely sleeping, treating enterrainment as luxury and waste of time, sacrificing their physical and mental well being. And for what? We produce more and more, yet our quality of life remains the same, or worsens. The more value we generate, the lower the proportion of that value remains with us.",
        "The 1953 decision of *Rumely v. United States* blew the top open for congressional corruption. It allowed congressmen to make money, hide money, and create huge advantages as the incumbent to stay in office, with no reporting requirements and no oversight. This gave wealthy corporations direct influence over how the post-war economy was changing. It was no longer in congresses' best interest to protect American households, but rather, they could become rich while in office through corporate sponsorships. Since then, lawmakers have had an express and direct incentive to vote against anything that would limit corporate or industrial freedoms. Or vote against wage increases voting against anything that would limit price increases in things like insurance costs, loan interest, government subsidies for already profitable industries, or any of the other decisions that have allowed things to get so out of hand in the US. It wasn't instant, it took decades to fully mature, and Reagan just piled more of the same on in the 80s, as well as cementing the idea of tax cuts for the rich, which gave rise to the CEOs if today making 500x the salaries of their employees and paying zero tax through loopholes that complicit lawmakers sold their votes for. Capitalism might work, but that's not really what we have anymore. Maybe some sort of oligarchy? I don't know all of my -isms well enough to say what the US has become.",

There aren't many loud things in nature that can't potentially harm you, so evolutionarily, it's been to our advantage for us to immediately refocus our attention to the source of any such noise, in order to decide whether it needs responding to. As intelligent creatures, we're often able to \"override\" our instinctual startle response. For example, if you know that someone in the next room is hammering a nail, you don't need to get panicked when you hear a loud bang. However, our capacity for doing this is influenced by a lot of things, and therefore isn't always reliable. Some people may simply have a hard time screening out background noises because of their natural makeup, whereas other people may have extra sensitive \"alert systems\" due to the experiences they've had in life."

These ideas had a huge impact on socialist thought and all western thought in general, one of the foundations of modernism. Sometimes Marxism is used as an ontological perspective for social analysis and research, that is, analysis centered on material aspects of a situation and how various material needs of different social classes create friction and resolve.

Some cases can be very hard for everyone involved, so I'm not that comfortable with ASD being called an 'enhancer'. But i'm not comfortable refering to it in a absolute negative way neither. In the field I find working with kids with ASD to be very demanding. A lot of stuff that we do as psychologist has the potential to work very differently with people with ASD, it requires specific training, and keeping up to date. Also requires to sometimes work with institutions and families that are or can become violent. I think my answer here is flawed, I lack experience and the few cases I had with kids that had ASD were very complex situations. I have considered multiple times to undergo specific training and work mainly with this population so I'm curious about what other commenters will write here."

Nasser publicly mocked the idea of women being made to wear hijabs in public, and people were laughing with him.  We HAVE seen a sort of counter-revolutionary push and surge in traditional Islamic thought and government in recent decades, which raises another interesting question as to why it happened, but it emphasizes that this is a very different situation than a bunch of countries that never secularized to begin with. ",
        "Throughout much of the Cold War, many Muslim-majority countries had very secular leaders like Ataturk-aligned leaders in Turkey, Pahlavi in Iran, Nasser in Egypt, etc. The problem is that some of these secular leaders were also dictators supported, trained, or otherwise propped by by foreign interests -- generally the US/UK or USSR specifically. So the main driver of secularism in these was top-down force from brutal authoritarian regimes which generally put the interests of their foreign benefactors over the interests of the people living in their countries. As you can imagine, this left a bad taste in the mouths of many people in these countries. The idea of \"secularism\" is strongly associated with foreign meddling and dictatorial rule, which is why you saw many \"revolutions\" taking on an Islamist character. You saw traces of this dynamic as recently as 2011 in Egypt. * The US-aligned, relatively secular leader Mubarak (who rules for 30 years, and technically won elections and referendums but also did stuff like press charges against his political opponents and [jail them during election years] was deposed. * In 2012 elections were held to determine the future leadership, and the people of Egypt voted for. . . the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Morsi. Islamist parties had a majority in parliament. * After protests in 2013, the military threw a coup d'etat against the new leadership, and a General Sisi (who was supported by Mubarak, the recently deposed dictator) assumed control of the country (in a totally fair and free election in which he won 97% of the vote). * There were more protests against Sisi after he took over, one of which was crushed in a [bloody massacre], which killed somewhere between 600-1,000 people yet curiously isn't reported on or talked about as much in English-speaking world. Maybe Sisi being more open to US influence and enthusiastically cracking down on the Islamist parties -- up to and including [sentencing 500+ of them to death] after a riot -- has something to do with it. * To be fair, the US's relationship with Sisi's government has been hot and cold. Obama was pretty cold to him, but Trump praised him a lot. But Sisi definitely has deep historical ties to the West, having attended military colleges in the US and UK. He's still in control of the country today, after winning another election in 2018. . . with 97% of the vote. So yeah, when \"secular\" becomes associated with \"brutal dictator who was trained/supported by the Americans\" then you can see how the populace might look upon secularism suspiciously.",
        "There is nothing unique about Christianity that lead to the majority Christian nations becoming secular. All we need to do is look at European history to see that's the case. So the circumstances that led to the majority of Christian nations becoming secular are not due to Christianity itself, but unique historical events that took place in Europe's history. The [Renaissance ] is a good example because Europe began to revive the cultural ideals (such as humanism) of Classical Europe. Those ideals were massively secular in comparison to the culture of Medieval Europe. The biggest contributing event, though, was probably the Protestant [Reformation ] because the power of the Pope over European nations was massively diminished. Similar to secularization, the reverse can happen due to historical events. Muslim nations have gone through periods where they were much more secular than they are now. I suggest you read up on the last 100 years or so of Middle Eastern history to get a good idea of what led to the current state of the ME.",
        "R1 Anthropology of Religion (Islam primarily, also secularism) ABD here. I think we should carefully think about what we mean when we secular! Here is a quick and dirty response (10 mins or less).... \"Secular\" in Britain, France, and the United States *are not identical and mean very different things.* In the United States, we think of \"separation of church and state\" - yet we *also* maintain observations of religious holidays as national holidays, and permit religious leaders to issue marriage certificates (with licensing, I believe), or to perform religious but non-legally binding ceremonies. In the UK, religion is considered a private, personal matter, but marriage is treated more like a private contract. However, there is a Church of England, intertwined with the monarchy, etc. Yet in France, we see very different perceptions of religion - it arguably has *no* place in the public sphere. Fernando describes secularism as both a \"mindset and practice\" - similarly Asad touches on how secularism distinguishes between local religious practices and observances as 'culture,' 'heritage,' and 'tradition' versus problematic, outsider \"religions.\" Despite the idea that every French person is \"French first\" and there is no Church of France (yet a Church of England), the French government does subsidize religious buildings or formally work with religious bodies in the Christian and Jewish communities, and many major holidays are Christian in origin yet nationally and socially observed. Islam, in contrast, is not seen as part of heritage or tradition - but as a potentially disruptive \"outside influence\" in Europe. And on the one hand, this makes sense! Islam did not develop or flourish in most of Europe (see Southern Spain for exceptions) - and when it did, it was an \"invasion.\" In the case of France, many French citizens and the children of French residents are former colonial subjects from North Africa and the Middle East, but are not \"really French\" because (1) they look different/speak a different language, (2) practice a different religion. While they are ostensibly French, their ability to be accepted as French will always be implicitly qualified on multiple levels. Similarly, we see Southern Spain have a legacy of *convivencia* \\- Catholics/Muslims/Jews living in community and equity - but Muslims are always kind of looked at with a layer of ambivalence and anxiety because they represent both diversity but the potential \"threat\" of historical (re)invasion. We can also look at Egypt as an example of a heavily influenced western legal system bolted onto local Arab, Muslim, and indigenous traditions and beliefs (see Agrama). Suffice to say, many Muslim countries were colonized, occupied, and forced to adopt outside beliefs and practices... which have their own assumptions about \"religion\" (mostly based on Christianity), which developed along a completely different trajectory. The entire conception of secularism is rooted in traditional western conceptions of religion and God, so... Without turning into a novel, I think the questions we should ask are \"What do *we* mean when we say secular?\" and \"what does secularism look like in X region or Y country\"? **Some Quick Sources:** Asad, [Formations of the Secular] Bowen, [On British Islam] Fernando, [The Republic Unsettled] **Formal Citations** Agrama, Hussein Ali. 2012.

        "There are many Muslim majority states with secular governments. Do you mean specifically in the Middle East and North Africa? Edit: I guess I should add this because people still seem to be confused as to what a secular state is and is not. Banning alcohol doesn't make a state a theocracy or mean it has a state religion. Having policies or laws that are heavily influenced by religion doesn't mean you are not a secular state. Ask if the things you are pointing out would have been true of the USA in the early 20th century. Does that mean the US was not a secular state?",
        "Because of the unique concepts coming from the Qur'an of sharia and fiqh, as well as urf. There is a dedicated philosophy and interpretation of these concepts spanning from the centuries in which Muhammed lived. The first Islamic caliphate established by him was also governed with these concepts. In my opinion, it's the result of a historical pathway that diverged from other Abrahamic religions. As for the definition of a Muslim country, it's tricky. There are countries with their religion stated in the constitution and those that do not, but have majority Muslim population. Having secularism in the constitution, I would say, is the first step for a country \"secularizing like Christian countries\".

So what they actually desire/expect from a religious government? I have no clue, but they seem to have some idealistic view that such a government could somehow work without facing the issues plaguing islamic countries now.

        "I think it has a lot to do with the industrial revolution. Although Muslim countries safeguarded a lot of observational science during the middle ages, with the Renaissance, Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution in Europe, the population became aware of what science and engineering could do and how it could put them, as human beings, in control of the world around them. This strengthened humanity's belief in itself and lessened its need to bow down before \"gods\". This process did not happen in the majority of Muslim countries, they remained locked in the same mindset as medieval Europe.

They have a tenuous albeit somewhat limited democracy kinda similar to T\u00fcrkiye with Erdogan who again is mildly secular. The largest Muslim country in the world is Indonesia which is secular. Iraq is a whole post unto itself. But short version, Iran is the continuation of Persia. Iraq has part of the Persian territory. While it was a colony that area and the rest of what now makes up Iraq was formed as that territory because of the competing factions. It\u2019s largely why Saddam Hussein was able to be so successful for so long. Lebanon had been at war or conflict for decades Kuwait is a western-backed former colony kingdom I think I\u2019ve gotten point across. Why didn\u2019t they secularize? Well Cold War, Imperialism and Colonialism dictated most of their state affairs that have continued to today. The rebels trying to fight for freedom have tended to be Islamic or Islamist so when they\u2019ve been successful they\u2019ve instituted Muslim governments. But these mirror the governments in Europe that are \u201csecular\u201d but have heads of state and official religions aligned with a Monarch like the UK or Denmark."

      "output": [
        "Being NEET is not an exclusively male phenomenon. Eurofounds 2016 work identifies quite a diverse range of people who are NEET. I have no idea about hikkomori though, and the fact that you are linking the two suggests that you are using the term NEET more in the way that it is used within internet culture rather than the way the term is used sociology. In sociology NEET is quite literal, and refers to any young person who is not in education or training. The age range used varies a bit but it typically refers to 16-29. It was originally developed as a concept to identify people who were failing to transition from education to employment and being left behind by the system in some way, it was seen as a alternative to measuring youth unemployment data didnt capture anyone who wasn't claiming unemployment benefits such as people still living with parents.  However as a statistical measure it's accepted that it also includes 'false NEETs' this is people who meet the technical definition but are doing something quite positive, like a gap year abroad, or being a young mother, so arguably not failing to transition in any way.",
        "In addition to what u/zukerblerg stated, hikikomori are not exclusively male, either. ([1], [2], [3] It's thought that female hikikomori are probably overlooked in research and by the general population due to a combination of expectations of domesticity for Japanese women and worse mental health outcomes for male hikikomori due to perceived gender failure (e.g. not fulfilling prescribed social role as provider for a family).",
        "Firstly, as others have said, these aren\u2019t exclusively male phenomenon, but instead that the male versions are what is talked about in modern society. Cat ladies, spinsters, \u201cleftover women\u201d are all versions of this for women. Also, technically, being a homemaker/stay-at-home mom is considered NEET for women by some academics so there are a lot of women, especially young mothers who can\u2019t afford childcare for their children, who fit in to this conceptualization depending on how you define it. One reason why men may be more likely to be \u201cNEET\u201d is that they have to do far less chores than their female counterparts if they live at home. Young men who live at home with their mothers do less domestic labor than their fathers and get to benefit from their parents superior living situation while essentially receiving a full time domestic worker [[1]]. Also worth mentioning that these aren\u2019t \u201cmodern epidemics\u201d as unmarried middle aged sons and daughters have been troubling their families for all of recorded history. The big difference is that, in the past, a marriage could be arranged which forced two people to live together even when they had no interest in doing so. Last but not least, the gender disparity in how we talk about these concepts has something to do with how we conceptualize these terms relative to their gender roles. For men, these behaviors are deviant because they represent a forgoing of the male gender role of being the breadwinner and active pursuer of a partner. The social contract is broken because these men show no motivation to do the economically valuable labor required to earn a partner and support a family. For non-homemaker women, these behaviors are deviant because they represent a forgoing of the duties of domestic labor on behalf of a partner and children. Women are breaking the social contract largely by being unwilling to do a disproportionate share of completely economically valueless domestic and emotional labor. In other words, part of the reason the male phenomenon \u201cmatters\u201d is because of how we ascribe economic value to the labor and achievement of traditionally male behaviors vs. those of women."

        "This is a good question! And one of my favorite but not often talked about 101 classes!! &#x200B; When we are confronted with new information there is really basically two cognitive choices \\- accommodation: changing our 'script' to include the new information or \\- assimilation: Re-interpreting the new information through the lense of our script. This can be super confusing because you're dealing with the 'how' we interpret information not the info itself exactly. Cognitive dissonance could be described as the state of not being able to do either, and/or bouncing between the two. &#x200B; An example: You meet your new dating relationship of 1 month and they ask to move into your place! You already have set ideas about 1 year being the right length Accommodation would be adjusting your script to say maybe 1 month is OK Assimilation: would be really any interpretation of the request that didn't change your script - e.g. person is a red flag - not a good partner etc. Keep in mind the accommodation isn't compromising or adjusting your decisions its updating your perspective based on that new info so not \"oh well I guess I'll lower my boundaries\" but rather \"oh my current partner is rushing the relationship maybe my idea about what rushing is or isn't needs to change\""

Fundamentally, it seems you are asking about how psychology interacts with, but also differs from philosophy. This was a topic I got a good understanding on from my history and systems class. Psychology, as a science, is really in its infancy. Most tend to attribute it's formation to Willhelm Wundt in 1800's Germany, but psychological thought was influenced heavily by philosophers, and some psychological perspectives are really more philosophical in origin than scientific. Essentially, many perspectives like behaviorism, neo-behaviorism, cognitive, positive, social, gestalt, etc. are scientific. Yet, some like humanist and psychoanalytic are more philosophical in nature, but that doesn't necessarily mean there hasn't been any evidence to support them. I believe that the psychoanalytic perspective has become more scientific as it's evolved past Freud. I hope that makes sense.",
        "Philosophy is the bedrock where many other disciples are seated. You need a strong philosophical base to start thinking about matters of the mind, and the human person, and the well-being since those are prominent topics withing psychology. From that philosophical bedrock science, and of course psychology, get their fundamental concepts (which are developed further in their own right and study within psychology). The mind, the self, well-being, all of those and more are essential in the practice of psychology. You can look that, all great psychologist have a strong bases in philosophy as well."

        "Okay. So I'm not a medical professional, but my guess is that this sort of behavior is normalized for some reason so these men don't see anything wrong with what they're doing. From an outsider's perspective it seems like a lot of these individuals are seeing women as objects that they're entitled to rather than humans with feelings and boundaries. If you're interested in anecdotal stuff, I'm a Chinese person who lives in the US and I've noticed that things like consent and consideration for the feelings of other people are more heavily emphasized and taken seriously in western families than in my home country. So maybe a lack of this sort of education is common in other underdeveloped countries too? Especially in the Asian community where some of us are a bit notorious for not wanting change. Rape itself doesn't seem very common in my own country. But when any form of sexual abuse does happen, the victim is often blamed for the incident and in my personal experience, we're likely to be told not to tell anyone about it because of worry about our own reputations. Unfortunately this sort of pattern can be present in any other place on the globe and shows abusers that they can get away with their actions, which subsequently makes them much less likely to see how wrong their actions were. India probably has this much worse than many other countries and I'm sorry that you're having to live in a place like this. Ps: I just reread your post. Please know / be reminded that there is never a good or valid reason to rape someone. By raping or sexually abusing anyone in any way shape or form, the offender is knowingly violating a person's body, personal space, and sense of dignity. It permanently alters and scars a victim's life. It is evil and unforgivable. Even murder can probably be more ethical depending on how it's committed. If anything like this ever happens to you or someone you know, please report it or at least tell someone about it. You are not alone."

      "output": [
        "Reinforcement makes the actual desired behavior more likely to happen, and can be used to \"shape\" behavior. This is inherently better than just reducing undesired behavior. People also may try to evade detection to avoid punishment, rather than stopping or reducing the behavior. Punishment that is too severe or seen as unfair can also lead to worse behavior than if there wasn't an intervention.",
        "At least for me, it's simpler to think about in terms of mammalian emotion, and approach vs. avoidance motivation than mechanistically in terms of neurological circuitry of reward and punishment. If you've ever tried training a dog with positive reinforcement, it can emerge quickly that they will learn to actually *want* to do things for you. If they don't know what you're asking them to do, but they know you're asking for something, they'll try any behavior they can think of to get the treat until they land on the right one. This comes in part from the dog learning that *you yourself* are a source of reward or even an *intrinsic* reward to be around and interact with. The expectation of reward when trying new behaviors around you creates [a behavioral source - in the dynamical systems sense] (see the Poincare diagram a quarter of the way down) that leads to generation of new situations. Compare to being generally punishing. It's true of dogs, kids in abusive households and individual workers in jobs with hostile management chains that pretty quickly you learn *not* to stick your neck out, and *not* to try anything new (or anything at all, outside of what's likely in these environments to be a very limited and perceptually unrewarding family of behaviors that grant access to that environment's scarce rewards). If the environment does have *some* minimal reward, this is likely to set up behavioral *sinks* (as opposed to sources) that drive the people or animals there back towards the same set points (think addictions, as in [Carl Hart's \"rat park\" experiments] where repetitive stimulation with a drug is a lot less appealing to rats in highly enriching environment, i.e. those with a lot of behavioral rewards leading to source points of new behaviors and exploration, or to [response of repetitive behaviors to safety signals] given a history of extreme signals of environmental threat). To your credit, I don't actually think this is necessarily a simple or easy area to describe or understand. It can capture a lot about what it is to be a mammal, or to have a brain, or a body at all that's capable of experiencing threats or expectations, or punishments or rewards. There could well be other aspects of how that works on the \"wiring\" level that I haven't captured here, but I think the description in terms of behavioral approach and avoidance goes a long way to describe *what it's like* to be in these situations, either as the one administering reward or punishment and anticipating results, or as the one trying to figure out how to get the environment to give you the responses you'd like. Let me know if you have any clarifying questions or other ways to go with it. To my knowledge it's still an active area of research and I'd be happy to help try to look more up.",
        "It depends. People tend to react negatively to negative reinforcement and punishment. It can be effective but it can also lead to a rift. People tend to stay engaged with positive reinforcement which may be slower to be effective but can have longer term positive impact. However. People with anti-social tendencies will simply take advantage if there is no inhibitory consequences (not necessarily the same as negative reinforcement).",
        "Oh, bless your heart for mixing up negative reinforcement and punishment, but don't worry, it's a common slip-up! So, you're scratching your head, wondering why giving someone a gold star works better than a slap on the wrist, especially when we're all supposedly doom-scrolling addicts, right? Here's the scoop: our brains are like, \"Ooh, shiny!\" whenever we get a pat on the back. That dopamine hit? It's real and it's fabulous. It turns out, getting a treat makes us want to do the thing more, not less. Who knew? Well, pretty much every dog trainer and kindergarten teacher, that's who. And about that negativity bias \u2013 sure, we're great at remembering that one time we embarrassed ourselves in public, but that doesn't mean we learn better from fear of embarrassment than from the promise of praise. We're not just wired to avoid getting eaten by lions; we're also wired to repeat actions that get us those sweet, sweet rewards. So, while you might think getting zapped would keep us in line, it's actually those gold stars and high fives that make us want to keep up the good work. Go figure!",
        "It's really not that reinforcement is more effective than punishment in any universal sense. It's that one can usually achieve the same ends without resorting to punishment by identifying and effectively applying the correct reinforcer for that behavior. For instance: If every time I pushed a big red button, someone gave me a dollar, I'd be very likely to keep pressing that button. If someone gave me a dollar every time I pushed the button, but at the same time touching the button gave me a very painful shock - well, that dollar isn't as valuable to me any more. BUT, if you gave me 1000$ each time I pushed the button, that would be far more reinforcing for my button pushing behavior even if the damned thing shocked me. In this simple case, my behavior can be modified any number of ways using punishment and/or reinforcement by scaling the value of the reinforcer or the intensity of the punishment. Keep increasing the level of shock until it has a 50% chance of killing me, but tell me that if I do it I'll get 50 million dollars, well now I'm even more likely to push that button than when there was no shock and each press only earned me a dollar, etc."

      "output": [
        "First off , great question. I had to dig on this one. Social isolation and social alienation are two concepts often discussed in sociology, psychology, and mental health contexts, with distinct meanings and implications. \"Social Isolation\" refers to a state where an individual has few social connections or interactions with others. It is often quantifiable, such as the number of friends someone has or the frequency of their social activities. Social isolation can be chosen or involuntary and can lead to feelings of loneliness and other negative health outcomes. It is more about the physical separation from others and the lack of social contact. \"Social Alienation\" is more about a subjective feeling of being estranged or disconnected from the social environment or community. It involves feelings of not fitting in, of being fundamentally different, or of not being understood by others. This can happen even when individuals are not physically isolated and may be surrounded by people. Social alienation is often discussed in the context of societal issues, such as the alienation of workers in a capitalist society, where it refers to the lack of control over one's work and the sense of being disconnected from the product of one's labor. In essence, social isolation is more about the absence of social contacts and connections, while social alienation deals with feelings of estrangement and disconnection from society or community, regardless of the presence of others.

        "There's no good answer for this question. In fact, the idea that there's a certain type of person most likely to be radicalized is, in itself, a dangerous one. As a threshold question, there's no consensus on what the term \"radicalization\" even refers to. It's as much a political definition as anything -- the old adage about \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\" comes to mind. Taking up force of arms against a state is usually considered \"radical,\" but by that definition, should we consider American revolutionaries to have been \"radicalized\"? Or the WW2 French Resistance against the Nazis? Who decides what's radical, and what's good and proper? Even if we settle on a definition of radicalization, the problem is compounded by the fact that, by any objective metric, it's only a very small percentage of the population who participates in extremist violence. So any \"profile\" you build is, by necessity, going to include an awful lot of nonviolent people who simply happen to be demographically similar to a very, very small population of violent individuals. Perhaps the best-known case of this domestically was when the FBI conducted [obtrusive surveillance of mosques ] within the US, because they wrongly conflated \"devout beliefs in Islam\" with \"violent tendencies.\" Yes, many perpetrators of Islamist violence have strong beliefs, but the vast majority of devout Muslims never commit extremist violence -- and that's true for every demographic you can think of. Even then, the demographics of \"radicals\" change depending on the political moment. Within far-right extremism, violent acts tend to be committed by individuals who fit the general profile for criminality -- young, unemployed men without families. But that profile didn't hold up for January 6 insurrectionists, [most of whom] were middle-class and had comfortable lives. Finally, because the population of people who commit acts of extremist violence is so small, it's very hard (a) to access them, and (b) to do any kind of representative study. See [this study], which argues that most (75%) published academic work on \"radicalization\" relies on secondary sources and suffers from broad leaps and sweeping conclusions about what \"radicalization\" is and how it functions."

Look up the founder of Keloggs cereal and how he made a bland cereal to help people resist sexual desire. (This is real) I think it stems from ideas of initial sin. When Adam and Eve ate the fruit they went against God's wishes and now people must live life in penance to make up for it or they are reveling in sin. I think there's more sources like the story with Sodom etc. Many religions adopt the tenant \"be fruitful and multiply\" as well, probably because those that don't are at a disadvantage and disappear. Sex for any other purpose than procreation doesn't result in new believers (as you adopt your parents religion).

I do not have any friends who shun premarital sex, and I talk openly about birth control and sexual pleasure with my female friends. Considering my social circle consists of people who view premarital sex as a healthy activity, I can only imagine that that of someone who views it as distasteful reflects the inverse. If everyone whom you know and can call a friend discourages something and sees it as immoral, it is pretty difficult to look kindly upon those who engage in it freely, especially when doing it irresponsibly could lead to unintended consequences.

The reason they platform against non-traditional sex so hard is bc traditional sex and gender roles are all the rage in religious circles.

        "It was up till very recently in human history were many STDs were death sentences. Think of a time before paternity tests where people in your community mostly looked the same. Contraception massively lowering the risk of unintended pregnancy. Modern technology has diminished most of the risks surrounding sex, however those risk alerts are still deeply ingrained in many people's psychology. Not to mention studies showing strong monogamous culture is associated with less violence inside societies.",
        "Few people are \"freaked out\" by recreational sex. Most people against it just see it as over all damaging to society. Specifically, sex which is engaged in by two people who are not in any committed relationship. Almost no one but extreme Irish Catholics care if a couple has sex for fun.",
        "The value of the wedge it creates is motivation to dominate politics. That people get freaked out about recreational sex, i.e. free people enjoying their lives, is just a quality of insecurity to exploit for votes. The politicians and power players who exploit these voters aren\u2019t concerned about recreational sex beyond how much power they can derive from the electorate over the topic.",
        "The idea that sex is for pro-creation only is a very very ancient concept which most people don't subscribe to. My grandmother was a young woman in the 1920's. A belief of pro-creation only was seen as very outdated and old fashioned by my grandmother who was somewhat conservative.. This was true for most of her circle of friends.  My grandmother knew a woman who practiced this (her friend was very devout Catholic) and the woman's husband cheated on her which was no surprise to anyone. This pro-creation only allowed men to cheat on their wives who they would be blamed for their cheating. I'm 62 years old and I don't know anyone at all who advocates or practices pro-creation sex only. That goes back hundreds of years. Since there wasn't reliable birth control hundreds of years ago, this was probably one reason why it was practiced or was practical. It certainly isn't now. In modern times for most people one aspect of sex is to have children, if you chose to. It's also for pleasure. Most people believe that if you are a consenting adult, then it's your business what you do in bed. Government and the law shouldn't intervene in what is private. People who freak out over reactional sex find this belief to be appalling because it's a threat to the traditional order of things. But at the same time, many of them also engaged in this behavior but that is okay because it's them. It's okay for them but not for others. They usually don't call individuals out on this because then, people will start looking into their personal life and they don't want that. Back in the 1920's, you had laws on the books in most states that banned co-habitation, adultery, pre-martial sex, oral sex, but those laws didn't apply to those who were middle or upper income people as they were rarely enforced against them, especially rich people. Certain groups of women or people were targeted, usually those in low socio-economic status. My grandmother knew people who broke all those laws but due to their social standing they got away with it. Even if someone went to the police to report the violations, nothing would have happened. These were mostly middle to upper income to wealthy people. Nearly all of those laws are thankfully off the books but you still have a few states that had these laws on the books. No one touches these with a ten foot pole because they don't want their sex life to become public or be exposed for not living family values.",
        "I don't believe politicians of any party are \"freaked out by sex\" or any other issue, part of being a politician is to detect wedge issues, they can use to further their careers, could be sex/migration/race/war...etc, once they find something that resonates, they run with it and try to convince as many people as they can to feel strongly about an issue most folks actually didn't care or thought about before, I know this sounds anti climatic, but its what it seems to me",
        "I think it's more societally motivated and there's not so much interest in what people do recreationally in their own bedroom. Some forces in society want good normal families, others perhaps benefit from something on the other end of the spectrum; broken families introduce more malleable children which of course are targets for manipulation. It's the children aspect about it, less so bustin nuts/ovaries.",
        "Because some people heavily associates sex with emotion and have trouble even contemplating those that don't. There's also some serious concerns to be had about things like the spread of STDs as many people who are more sexually promiscuous are not just going to take their one night stand down to the lab testing place to get an HIV test every single time they want to have a one night stand. Not to mention that pretty much everyone I know who is actively promiscuous is clearly not happy and that promiscuousness is caused by a deeper problem usually some sort of depression or something like that (Personally I don't think we should completely ban it or anything but I can understand why there's concern about it)",
        "The reason for virtually everything we do is the desire to increase human happiness. That is the primary motivation behind virtually all philosophies, and virtually all political ideologies. When you see people, \"telling other people how to live\" what they are really doing is advancing the policy positions they think will WORK, to increase the chances that more people are happy. Let me repeat: This is true of virtually ALL philosophies and political ideologies. The rub, of course, is that people disagree about what things are likeliest to result in greater happiness. But that really is the motivation. People who say that economic security is the most important policy object do so because they think that that increases the chances of human happiness for the greatest number of people. Those who think that economic freedom is most important do so for the same exact reason. Work hard. Get an education. Serve your community. Make your bed. Be kind to animals. Don't drink too much. Treat everyone equally. Get up early. Get enough sleep. Raise your children well. Commit to your relationships. These are, all of them, the collective \"wisdom of the ages.\" They are things that experience has shown contribute to health, security, safety and yes, happiness. You can disagree with any or all of them, of course. But please understand the motivation behind them. It is not to control you, it is not to make you follow rules that are arbitrary and serve no purpose. It is to, in the opinion of those advancing those ideas, increase your chances of a good life. TL/DR People are motivated to advance a particular political agenda because they believe because they belief it offers the surest route to success and happiness for the greatest number of people."

        "The Matthew effect is THE classical sociological concept to explain the phenomenon outside of Marxist theory. Coined by Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman. It's pretty simple: You start with a slightly unequal distribution of money (or anything else that provides an individual advantage) and over time the distribution will become more unequal. The reason: people with slightly more money have slightly more resources to get even more money and vice versa. If you have only 10,000 Dollars, 1% interest rate yields 100 Dollars. If you have 1,000,000 Dollars, 1% interest rate yields 10,000 and so on. This basic principle means that even small differences between people will lead to huge inequalities over time, unless society has put mechanisms into place that redistribute these gains and keeps society from becoming too unequal.",
        "\"Why is inequality increasing\" is a different question from \"why are there people who don't have food\", as inequality can increase even as everyone becomes richer. Anyway, global income inequality has been [falling] in the 21st century, though I wouldn't be surprised if wealth inequality was still increasing. If you're asking why some countries have come out ahead of others though, I recommend *Why Nations Fail* by Acemoglu and Robinson. If this is about increasing inequality in the United States, it's due to the [college wage premium] (people who went to college became more in demand since the 80s) and increased capital income, especially [housing]. Though there are also some other factors that had an effect, like the decline in labor unions and a motionless minimum wage.",
        "Marx\u2019s conflict theory is a potential explanation. [Conflict theory] makes three assumptions. One, that humans are rational beings acting to maximize their self-interest. Two, the resources which humans seek are limited. And three, that the pursuit of scarce resources by rational, self-interested beings will necessarily lead to conflict.  The theory has its flaws, but I think it does a good job to explain why classes are constantly in conflict. Unfortunately, I think that limited resources aren\u2019t an innate issue, but rather a man-made problem resulting from an unfair distribution of said resources. It\u2019s also important to consider that money drives us all. Those who have it want even more of it, those who don\u2019t have it, need it. Both parties are actively working to make more, but it\u2019s easier to make money when you\u2019re already well-off. Let\u2019s not even start on the politics. Fortunately, conflict theory also argues that this constant conflict marks imminent change, sooner or later."

        "Daannii's comment covers a lot of this, but I'm going to try to rephrase it into a more eli5 thing. There are different types of things we are talking about when we use the term 'memory.' Typically people are referring to episodic memories, 'yesterday I went to the beach and had lunch with my aunt.' HM could not form new episodic memories. Explicit memory refers to memories you can consciously recall. Some of that is episodic, but consider how much of it isn't. Do you remember what the Capital City of the State of Washington is? Do you remember what currency values different coins have? Do you remember the name of this fish? Do you remember your parents names? HM was also quite impaired on learning new words and facts, but this impairment was not as absolute. After being repeatedly exposed to the information, he was able to recall information about JFK's assassination, and the name of the researcher he worked with. Similarly, he eventually learned the general knowledge fact that he had a memory problem. HM was the least impaired in acquiring new tacit memories. These are things you learn on a non explicit level. Habits, routines, muscle memory, ect... can have explicit components, but they run on a heavy foundation of autopilot from conditioned experience over time. For HM, seeing his hands had aged, or his face in a mirror, would be surprizing on an explicit level, but not a tacit level. He would explicitly see a face he wouldn't remember, but it wouldn't FEEL strange. It can be counter intuitive, but the tacit component often carries a lot more weight. One of the most fascinating, but also horrible [conditions] people can have is a disruption to the perception of other people that has the same split only backwards. They explicitly recognize other people as looking like they are supposed to, but it doesn't FEEL like it's them. It often goes... very badly.",

His case also quite clearly demonstrated the distinction between procedural and episodic memory. Researchers started teaching him the backwards mirror drawing task. Every time he was asked to do it he would say he had never done it before and would need to be provided the instructions - however, he got better and better at it. That is, while he didn\u2019t remember that he had been practicing the task, he was showing clear practice effects.",

When an affair is revealed this may still trigger aggression but also confusion, and while rationalization may occur I don't really like this portrayed as some sort of \"defense mechanism\" that get's triggered, its more like people try to make sense of a new and adverse big event and may try to process this in a way that reduces cognitive dissonance etc, which I guess you could call a defense mechanism - but its less of a reactionary brain thing and more of an active process of sense-making"

OCD is a way more complicated condition. It starts with something that everyone experiences-an intrusive thought. Those are thoughts about sth that is incredibly taboo, disgusting or outrageous to the person having the thought and can be a number of things (thinking about jumping from a bridge, harming a child, doing a sexually devious act, breaking a religious law...). This is always unpleasant and potentially frightening, but people with OCD don't move past it.

She argues that where parents go wrong is: 1) Discouraging kids from helping until they can do things \"right.\" 2) Framing help as \"chores.\" As in something that is unpleasant and someone else tells you to do it. Instead, she argues that parents should simply bring their kid with them when they do chores and allow the kid to help when they show an interest. Often kids will want to help as soon as they can even as a toddler. She suggests allowing them much more freedom than parents in industrialized nations typically do and not criticizing them when they do something wrong. Only intervene if they are about to do something dangerous. She also notes that the parents in the tribes she studies do not force their kids to help. When the kids are allowed to help at a young age then they feel like they are an important part of the group and will continue helping because humans are naturally social."

        "I\u2019m one of those people in-part. I constantly have an awareness of 2-5 distinct types of mental processes going on at the same moment in time: 1. My conscious thoughts (which does not seem to be exactly the same as how an \u201cinner dialogue\u201d is typically described as it\u2019s more like an awareness of a \u201cchecklist\u201d that\u2019s chronically ongoing to check my perspective, experience, understanding, etc. of what\u2019s happening in the moment against my own, past internal living experiences, that I have previously received from the other[s] involved validation of my adequately understanding them in past interactions, biases I know I still hold that I am working through, and the context of the interaction along with the environment [at minimum]); so, it\u2019s less of a dialogue to myself and more of an internal, mental process. 2. My subconscious thoughts: **This is more along the lines of which I believe you\u2019re directly seeking people\u2019s experience in having** (if I\u2019m assuming correctly since this is a relatively new area of research with limited word descriptors). So, I get these strange sensations in the back of my brain that tells me that I have some kind of \u201cdots connecting \u2018in the background\u2019\u201d that is also chronically ongoing; typically, I have a \u201csense\u201d of what it\u2019s about (often, it\u2019s more than one thing at a time to which I experience these types of *sensations* of such heightening to identify the processing order, identifying the priorities of which to anticipate next in terms of \u201cthem\u201d [for lack of a better term] entering into my consciousness so I am better equipped with such before it turns into something my brain \u201cchecks\u201d as described in my explanation 1 above). I can\u2019t put into any words what \u201cthe things (or topics, upcoming realizations, etc.)\u201d are *per se*, but I have non-communicative *sensations* that give me physiological reactions in my body that gives me an idea of the general scope of what they may involve so that I am able to mentally and emotionally prepare myself. 3. My environmental awareness; at all times of every waking hour, I am aware of the stimuli around me that my brain is taking in, analyzing, comparing, categorizing, placing into the 1 or 2 processes above, etc., my brain is typically using roughly 84% of the time simply processing all the stimuli that it\u2019s taking in: always. So, I tend to be a fairly verbally limited person or risk becoming \u201cbacklogged\u201d in my own mental processes (similar to explanation 2; but, not the actual same because my brain sensations when such happens hits more in the front [at my forehead region] and it just feels \u201cclogged up\u201d [unlike explanation 2 where it has more of a \u201cchurning,\u201d \u201cmaintaining,\u201d or similar sensation]); I have a photographic memory that seems outside of my control that can even be imprinted as a 4D memory at times (i.e. recall the HD version in moving pictures, color, and even feel the physiological effect in my body the same as I did in the literal moment) and I contribute the most of my frustration of acute, time-consuming stimuli processing on this. 4. Brain electrical stimulation by way of intense human interaction; when I am speaking, connecting, etc. with someone else, I can tell how much we genuinely connect and/or understand each other because I can literally feel my brain\u2019s electrical activity in differing levels (which gives me such answer). When it\u2019s extremely intense \u2014 \u201con the same page\u201d (for lack of a better term) \u2014 I will literally sees \u201cdots\u201d (similar to when you\u2019re lightheaded, but a vastly different sensation), feel my pupils dilate, feel like \u201cworms wiggle around in my brain\u201d as such interaction is happening. I can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d into my brain or have any words or other thoughts about it; again, it\u2019s all sensory related that \u201ctells\u201d me anything. 5. Synesthesia; I am synesthetic and it\u2019s just an abstraction of spatial colors, numerals, shapes and sensory experiences that typically relate to sounds and emotions, depending on the circumstances. It has no words or dialogue or whatever else like that; and, in my experience it is more so related \u2014 happens \u2014 when I\u2019m also neurologically processing in the number 1-4 ways above, or at least have experienced all of numbers 1-4 very recently all around the same time. Note: The reason I put these all in different categories is because I *feel* distinct areas of my brain\u2019s inner-workings as each happens (except for explanation 4 which can be any or all + more areas of those above, depending on the intensity of the connection with other humans). Not sure this is at all completely relevant or whatever; but, the above is how my brain processes things that I\u2019m aware of and none of which includes a word-driven, \u201cinner dialogue\u201d at all. My words form from what I think I\u2019ve heard from others that are relevant to the stimulation of my mind above-described, but applied to how my personal living experiences are. I am acutely aware of communicating into words via my consciousness and level of self-awareness at all times (so, if I sense number 2 up and coming into my consciousness, I typically ask for more time to think about things beforehand; and, when I speak in general I probably include more \u201cdisclaimers\u201d [e.g., saying something like, \u201cat least as of what I\u2019m aware of myself at this time\u201d] more than makes people generally feel comfortable which I feel bad about later and try to be as reassuring and comforting as I can when I misjudge, typically due to too much brain activity going on or a desire to simply connect more with someone since I\u2019m a social being as well)."

Like Abe Lincoln and Einstein. These guys could have just been good at acting like they had their shit together, but lived inner lives of turmoil and self-hate. We can't know. Maslow published his hierarchy in 1943. Lincoln was dead by then and could only have been interviewed posthumously. So, If you are studying and being the best, most studious version of yourself, and you wanted to call yourself self-actualized, I say you should. And if you don't feel self-actualized enough, just tell people you did some random thing like never lying about which trees you cut down when you were a kid, even if there's no way to prove it and it wouldn't actually mean anything about you even if you could, and pump yourself up a little. Lincoln probably did! He was a politician, after all! Great job on reaching self actualization, btw!"

For example a foundational paper on game theory in social dilemmas suggested that tit for tat was the best strategy to maximize outcomes. But that was based on a social dilemma that was free of noise. In human interactions it's almost impossible to have a social dilemma that's free of noise (noise being those little moments when we make mistake. Like arriving late to an appointment or misunderstanding what someone says and so having an inappropriate reaction). If people employed tit for tat strategies in real life situations where there is noise, then relationships would deteriorate and would not have any possibility of recovering. In noisy situations forgiving strategies fair much better than tit for tat. So I think as long as game theory studies are keeping one foot in the real world, they're fine.",

If it's about the psychology of how world leaders approach the prospect of nuclear war, it's exactly what you want. In clinical practice, it seems to be representative of a set of approaches that clients sometimes land on as an apparent strategy to deal with the ambiguity and stress of social situations without having to mentalize, build trust, or consider aspects of their own or others' inner worlds that are not so clearly instrumentally framed. It's not that game theory couldn't ever have something to say about what it's like to maintain relationships, manage closeness and distance or anything like that that makes up the usual bread and butter of therapy - in fact it could be really good at it, but characteristically, game theoretic takes don't take those kinds of situations either as examples or as applications.

      "output": [
        "Certainly has to do with neurodevelopment. Neurons prune, connect and potentiate through reinforcement. The more well worn these pathways become the less likely they are to change. However, this is not only the case for beliefs formed in childhood. If you have a belief in childhood (about say, the existence of an almighty man in the sky), and that belief is changed at 18 (no longer religious), and you hold that new belief for a further 40 years, your belief would be more difficult to change at age 58 than it was at age 18. Meaning that a belief formed in adulthood, in this case, is likely to be far more difficult to change than one formed in childhood. Time under stress is what really sets these things in stone. Long held beliefs are difficult to change, no matter when they are formed. It just so happens that most of our longest held beliefs are formed in childhood when we are most malleable. That said, neuroplasticity is at its peak in childhood, tapering off through adolescence and early adulthood. The evolutionary reason for this is quite simple. We come into the world needing to learn a hell of a lot, in a very short time, in order to do what organisms need to do. Once we\u2019ve learnt enough to survive, we no longer want a high degree of neuroplasticity, as too much flexibility means instability. So, it effectively switches off. There would be specific theories relating to this in the sub fields of evolutionary biology and developmental neuroscience. Try search terms: \u201cneuroplasticity\u201d, \u201cbelief formation\u201d, \u201cneurodevelopment\u201d, \u201cevolution\u201d AND \u201cneurodevelopment\u201d (AND \u201cneuroplasticity\u201d).

First, Bangladeshi-Americans represent a very small population (208,000 in 2019), and while they have a higher poverty rate than the average American (19% vs 13% in 2019), it is similar to Malaysians (16%), Nepalese (17%), with the highest among Asian groups being Burmese (25%). (All from 2019 US Census, linked below) Bangladeshi-Americans have higher rates of college/graduate degrees and higher English proficiency than the average American, so I would speculate that their higher poverty rate is due to the simple fact that roughly half are recent immigrants (49%), compared to only 34% of Asian-Americans as a larger group (Pew Research Center, same link as above). It may also be that the data are skewed by the fact that nearly half of Bangladeshi-Americans are concentrated in a single Metro area, New York City (93,000 out of 208,000 total in the US). Regarding crime statistics, in the US they are typically only recorded in terms of broad race/ethnicity categories such as \"white, black, asian\", so you are unlikely to find any more specific statistics particularly for such a small population such as Bangladeshi-Americans."

It is a good summary of a large literature overall. It provides some helpful definitions as well (loneliness versus isolation, for example).

        "From AI Hi, this is Copilot. I'm sorry to hear that you are having trouble with your research. Psychophysiology is the study of how the mind and the body interact and influence each other. It explores how psychological processes (such as emotions, thoughts, and behaviors) affect physiological processes (such as heart rate, brain activity, and immune system) and vice versa. \u00b9\u00b2 Some of the tools that psychophysiologists use to measure these processes are: - Electroencephalogram (EEG): This is a device that records the electrical activity of the brain by attaching electrodes to the scalp. It can show different brain waves that are associated with different mental states, such as alertness, relaxation, or sleep. \u00b3 - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This is a technique that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain and other organs. It can show the structure and function of the brain, and how different regions are activated by different tasks or stimuli. \u2074 - Computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan: This is a method that uses x-rays to produce cross-sectional images of the body. It can show the shape and size of the brain and other organs, and detect any abnormalities or injuries. Psychophysiologists can work in various settings, such as laboratories, hospitals, clinics, or universities. They can conduct experiments, diagnose and treat disorders, or teach and train students and professionals. Some of the topics that they are interested in are: - Stress and coping: How stress affects the body and the mind, and how people can manage and reduce stress. - Emotion and motivation: How emotions influence the body and the mind, and how they affect decision making, learning, and performance. - Health and illness: How the mind and the body can promote or impair health, and how psychological factors can contribute to or prevent illness. I hope this helps you understand psychophysiology better.

        "Think about it this way: a huge part of what our brain does is associative learning-- building connections between concepts so that they activate one another. I learn what a pen is because associations have been formed between a particular three-dimensional shape, and a particular sound (\"pen\") and a particular function. Consequently, anytime any of those concepts gets activated, it activates the other two, and thus I have a whole idea of a pen. Connections are what the brain is all about. You have connections between and memories of embarrassing times and feelings of sadness and shame (not just you, everyone has those connection). So if you remember times that were embarrassing, you feel sad and ashamed... but more than that, these connections go both ways, which means that when you feel sad and ashamed, you remember times that were embarrassing. What's more, it sounds like these feelings and memories get used so often that they stay close to the surface, so anytime your brain is looking for what to think about, there's a high probability that it will pick one of those and start the loop going. Your best bet for learning how to change these patterns is therapy (as someone else said, CBT is a good choice).

      "output": [
        "I think there are several problems here: One is I don\u2019t think there\u2019s strong evidence this is true moreso than blaming/ punishing the cheating partner. I can\u2019t find much study of social punishment of adulterous partners (outside of historical treatments of the law) and especially of the other adulterous participant. So in terms of scientific (and historical) evidence this appears to be an open question in need of study/ evidence. Another is insofar as it is true it\u2019s not clear this would be a particularly gendered phenomenon. Men may also blame the other man when their female partner cheats, and likewise in same-gender couples the cheated-upon partner may blame the other person rather than the cheating partner. As you note, using the lens of ancient mythology doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect modern thinking, but also there are multiple versions/ interpretations of the story. It\u2019s also worth noting that to make the myth parallel to your ideas Athene would need to be Poseidon\u2019s wife, which isn\u2019t the case. In the most \u201cblaming\u201d versions of the story in fact it would be closer to the truth to say Athene and Medusa were most like partners because Medusa is said to have been pledged to celibacy for Athene, and that\u2019s why she was punished, for breaking her pledge (in some versions, willingly). But other versions of the story say Athene knew the culprit was Poseidon but of course couldn\u2019t punish him, arguably a reflection of patriarchal realities, so the curse was actually a form of protection for Medusa. All that being said, more general studies of \u201ccheating behavior\u201d might lend some insight into why this might be a general dynamic if it is. For example, the study below suggests that punishment isn\u2019t primarily about returning reciprocal harm but inequity aversion. From this point of view arguably the \u201cother person\u201d is receiving the most one-sided benefit of cheating behavior, which makes them the key target for punishment behavior. This study doesn\u2019t get into it but it\u2019s also worth considering that especially if one wants to maintain the relationship there are incentives to not be *too* punishing of the cheating partner, whereas the same limiting incentives don\u2019t usually exist (at least at the same level) for the \u201cother person\u201d.",
        "While I don't know of a study comparing different cultures/environments with respect to blaming women for cheating, the collective evidence we have on infidelity, female attitudes towards other women, and patriarchal systems would suggest that this behavior is tied, at least in some part, to how patriarchal or misogynistic a community or region is. I think chimpanzees and bonobos are a good analogy for this trend. Chimpanzees are patriarchal. Females are typically low on the social hierarchy and are forced to compete for food and resources. As a result, they don't form very close social bonds. They are often abused or molested by the males. Murder (including of babies) is not uncommon in chimpanzee societies. Bonobos on the other hand, are more egalitarian and sometimes matriarchal depending on the tribe. This is due largely to female bonding. They at one point shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees, but as a result of a food surplus the females didn't have to compete as much and began to form bonds with each other, eventually forming groups and defending each other against violent males. Today, females in Bonobo society share very close bonds. We see a similar trend in human societies today. In a trend known as patriarchal bargaining, women in more patriarchal societies seem to focus less on holding men accountable for equal treatment in relationships or social institutions: Why this may be, is complex. Some theorize that it's because women in patriarchal societies adopt hierarchal lenses of operating in the world (e.g. competition over mates as opposed to focusing on connection). Others theorize that it just isn't as practically feasible to hold men accountable for their actions in a patriarchy, so women's only hope for fidelity is to try to hold other women accountable for trying to attract their partners. This is supported by evidence that women in patriarchal cultures are not encouraged to hold men accountable for infidelity (or even punished for doing so): The study below shows that women have more negative attitudes towards sexual infidelity in societies with less strict gender roles around child-rearing. The study didn't focus on who they would blame, but it is interesting that gender roles seem to influence how people feel about sexual infidelity in general: I would love to see a study that takes the next step and actually compares this trend between countries or communities that have been ranked based on level of patriarchy/misogyny. I would predict that in more egalitarian societies, men would be held more accountable for their own infidelity, as opposed to women blaming themselves or each other."

        "I research (and have) autism and ADHD so I suppose it's my time to shine. To put it simply, the difference is substantial - they are entirely separate, and differ in various clear-cut ways. Neurodivergence refers to diverging from typical neural development, this divergence being underpinned by a complex set of mostly genetic but also some early environmental factors. Notable trait differences can already be seen by age 2-4 for autism traits, and typically by 6 for ADHD traits. These trait differences are not caused by trauma and occur in the presence or absence of it, though of course, in those who do experience significant traumatic events, particularly at an early age, it could well affect any neurodevelopmental traits they are already at elevated genetic likelihood for as well. In contrast, trauma is an environmental exposure and risk factor for developing a range of issues, rather than a condition or trait in itself. It may cause some to experience symptoms that look similar to neurodivergent traits, for example by causing trouble paying attention and regulating behaviour. However, most people experience significant trauma, if not during childhood then during adulthood, and if those people are not from particularly neurodivergent families, that trauma will not create or elicit traits of autism or ADHD. In those with autism and/or ADHD, trauma may well affect them more severely than a similar trauma would affect a neurotypical person, but the symptomatic consequences are largely the same as for more neurotypical people. There is currently no good evidence that trauma itself can cause notable increases in neurodivergent traits themselves where there were none previously, nor cause the onset of a neurodevelopmental condition. Neurodivergence runs heavily in families, and particularly in the case of ADHD, this can mean those families have more conflict, financial trouble, and parenting has been shown to be affected in a predominantly negative way, unfortunately. In other words, the two are entirely separate, but due to the way genetic influences affect families and parents, more neurodivergence does increase the risk for more conflict and trauma, and neurodivergent people may well be more susceptible to the harms brought on by trauma."

Psychology is daughter of philosophy and three significant groups we are interested here are the empirical Brittish school, continental philosophy that explored the innate features of the mind (Decartes as one of the pivots), and these were arguing for and counterarguing against the other 'school's thought'. Enter Kant that sort of dismantled the gap between the two, disproving that it's 'either-or' dilemma between perception and the intrinsic ability of the mind to learn, think and know, and established some basic rules on ho thinking works, still relevant today (book \"critique of the pure mind\"). Somewhere at the same time we had Hegel that grappled terms so that he is not yet clearly understood. Then we had students of Kant and Hegel, rarely the direct ones and mostly by thought, that continued this school of thaught. We are now interested i Fichte, founder of German idealism and his direct student, Johann Friedrich Herbart, who had works related to psychology and pedagogy. I know that he started teaching at university and created pedagogy class, an area tightly related to speculative psychology, predominant at the time. Then we can remark the dynamics of real-time spread of ideas and thoughts - Herbar took a chair in Koeningsburg, right after Kant. Before that, he tought at the university of Gottingen. Now, we follow another stream of education - medicine. Wundt was a student of Hasse, a surgeon and psychologist. Hasse was a student of Weber who started experimental psychology in a way, and who was a student od Chladni, who was a physicist (where the experiment is almost everything). Chladni was a student of Lichtemberg, who in turn lectured at the university of Gottingen, even before Kant. This guy was a student of a matematician that lectured in Lepcig, the same place where Leibnic lectured, as well as Wundt. Logistics were important at that time, both translation and acquiring of books, academic discussions were limited to smaller pochets and areas connected by monumental works. Then we have the importance of language. Latin was slowly been supressed as the go-to language of academic writing. Philosophy, medicine, and physics happened to rely on 1. Analythic thought, 2. The crafting of new teminology. German language happened to be highly analytical in its nature, and highly prone to compound words, which gave high plasticity, nuance and most importantly precision in creating new terms. We also have three significant geographic-historical areas to mention. We had the German states, Swizerland, and Austro-Hungarian empire. Austria was sort of a center of the world at a time (when Freud came around). German was for a short but significant period of time the language of science, at least in that part of the world and of course, native and bilingual German speakers were favored in terms of moving it foreward. This gathered other nations to the table, like Chzech or Polish. You can see echoes of this era in the 19th and early 20th century US, where a big part of scientists and psychologists were of German or Swiss or Austrian descent. Also, in a sense, we can easily mix German speaking subgroups from our perspective. Freud was Austrian Jewish, Jung was Swiss, Wundt was German, and James was from the US and chose to write in German because the language brought more clarity to the topic. I got Kant's critique from a friend, Serbian translation. He complained that the translation was incomprehensible. He speaks German just a little, but he said he could follow the book more easily when he tried reading it in German. In some of our classes, we had training to \"germanize\" our reading in Serbian to overcome the semantic and syntax bariers innate to Serbian. Croatians (who were part of Austria and geographically closer) did a way better job at translating German (or any language) that some reads were mandatory to read in Croatian translation. This is not to say that other nations stayed idle in their contribution to psychology or any field. In the mid 20th century, French psychology was blooming (world is not the same after Piaget, breakthroughs in positivism and experimentalism, Binet and Simone), them, Hungarians, and Italians brought some of the greatest paychoanalysts, Americans gave birth to behaviorism, there's Thorndike, Dutch contribution not only by individuals but also through their critical and individualistic attitude. It's tricky to write it now, but Luria and of course Vygotsky are fundamental for understanding the development. So, in a sense, psychology was conceived as a joint endeavor of many nations, was incubating in the German-speaking world, and sprouted and bloomed in the 19th and 20th century across the world.",
        "When I was growing up in the 1990\u2019s, German and Austrian intellectual dominance was still palpable to me. The majority of the thinkers and writers I read and pondered \u2014 Nietzsche, Kant, Freud, Jung, Kafka \u2014 wrote in German.  The 19th century, and the first part of the 20th century, was a heyday of German intellectual and cultural dominance, to the point where 19th century Americans such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Mark Twain applied themselves to learn that language; doing so for \u201cintellectual and cultural\u201d reasons was not at all a phenomenon in the 18th or 17th centuries.  The 19th to the mid-20th century was really the Bl\u00fctezeit, as regards philosophy (Kant, Hegel, Marx, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger); psychology (Freud, Jung, Adler, et al.); linguistics; sociology (Max Weber); the sciences (Albert Einstein). It fascinated me, at the time, and it\u2019s one of the reasons I applied myself to the study of German. Some speculations, on my part: \u2014- the economic and industrial ascent of German-speaking Europe, during this period, which helped drive cultural and intellectual achievement (similar to a wealthy and highly industrialized nation such as the United States spawning so many Nobel Prize winners) \u2014 the German university as powerhouse research institutions; German scholarship as starting with the Protestant cultural focus on *Biblical* scholarship, Biblical exegesis (mastery of the Bible as a text and of Christian texts in general, given the Sola Scriptura orientation of Lutheranism) which made the study of theology at German universities all the comparable to that of the Jewish yeshivas, where intellectual ability was focused on analysis of Biblical texts (e.g., the Torah).  Two peoples of the book \u2014 Christians and Jews \u2014 made massive contributions to intellectual life in German-speaking Europe. The idea would be that this cultural of scholarship started in German theological seminaries and radiated outward from there, applying to other domains and also to also to Catholic Austria \u2014 the *concreteness*, actually, of the German language, in which the underlying concepts that terms signify are laid bare in a way that encourages a ready grasp of the underlying principle.  Compare \u201cdreieck\u201d (\u201cthree-edge\u201d) with the comparatively abstract English word \u201ctriangle.\u201d Even more to the point, compare an abstract English word such as \u201chydrogen\u201d with a German word such as \u201cWasserstoff\u201d (\u201cwater-stuff, water-material\u201d).  Compare, even in a mundane context, \u201cpork\u201d with \u201cSchweinefleisch\u201d (\u201cpig-meat,\u201d \u201cpig-flesh\u201d) or \u201cbeef\u201d with \u201cKalbfleisch\u201d (\u201ccalf-flesh, calf-meat\u201d).  You start with the concrete, like building blocks, and work up from there to the abstract. A German word like \u201cWasserstuff\u201d (\u201cwater-material,\u201d \u201chydrogen\u201d) and \u201cDreieck\u201d (\u201cthree-edge,\u201d triangle) is more transparent, concrete, \u201cmanipulable\u201d to young minds learning how to think by more transparently enabling one to break things down, piece them apart (analysis) and assemble them, put them together (synthesis).  That German grammar and syntax is highly \u201carchitectonic,\u201d in this sense \u2014 for example, the difference between \u201c*ruf* uns von Brandenburg *an*\u201d (splitting apart the verb) and \u201csie hat uns von Brandenburg *angerufen* (fusing it together) \u2014 likely helps, as well, and has made me wonder whether it\u2019s enhanced German achievements in the domain of engineering. [in English, those sentences translate as \u201ccall us from Brandenburg\u201d and \u201cshe called us from Brandenburg\u201d). For a philosopher\u2019s opinion, here is Alfred North Whitehead on the phenomenon of German scholarship: \u201cThe possibilities of modern technology were first in practice realized in England, by the energy of a prosperous middle class. Accordingly, the industrial revolution started there. But the Germans explicitly realized the methods by which the deeper veins in the mine of science could be reached. They abolished haphazard methods of scholarship. In their technological schools and universities progress did not have to wait for the occasional genius, or the occasional lucky thought. Their feats of scholarship during the nineteenth century were the admiration of the world. This discipline of knowledge applies beyond technology to pure science, and beyond science to general scholarship. It represents the change from amateurs to professionals. There have always been people who devoted their lives to definite regions of thought. In particular, lawyers and the clergy of the Christian churches form obvious examples of such specialism. But the full self-conscious realization of the power of professionalism in knowledge in all its departments, and of the way to produce the professionals, and of the importance of knowledge in the advance of technology, and of the methods by which abstract knowledge can be connected with technology, and of the boundless possibilities of technological advance,--the realization of all these things was first completely attained in the nineteenth century; and among the various countries, chiefly in Germany\" (Alfred North Whitehead, \"Science and the Modern World\").",
        "Lots of people are in here talking about the German language, but I think culture has a very large role. For example, in the early and mid 1900s, France was a hotbed of philosophical thought. I think this was in part because they had absolute front-row seats to the 2 world wars, and had to reconcile the incredible suffering they saw and the way their existing belief structures were challenged. I know less about the history of Germany/Prussia, Austria, and Switzerland, personally, but I think doing some research on the history, especially at the turn of the century, may provide some insight into the context into which Freud, Jung, and others in the movement were influenced by. I can say, during this time, asylums in central Europe were majorly overcrowded, many people were seen as \"incurable,\" and asylums were turning into store-houses rather than places for rest and treatment. There was a lot of pressure for a change to happen in how psychological problems were viewed and handled. ( I think religion played a part as well, as others have mentioned. Not necessarily the religion of the individual thinkers, but the evolution of religious thought in the area. The Protestant Reformation began in Germany and spread quickly to other German-speaking areas, and one of it's important pushes was to put Bibles into the hands of laypeople, to teach them to read, and to encourage them to explore their questions for themselves rather than relying on a central authority to tell them the meaning. The religious diversity caused by Protestantism and Judaism and people moving into cities meant that taking a religious approach to helping people with psychological problems wasn't going to work for everyone, as each person's religious views differed.",
        "Remember that Jung was a colleague of Freud. Likely this happened because burgeoning fields of study would need a university or other group to agree to fund their work and research. Then you'd have people interested in getting into this newly established field with no option but to go to the only place it's being researched. It's also worth pointing out that with the slow speed of data transmission at that time the field itself wasn't something most people would have known about to get involved with. Radio had only just been invented and used at the turn of the century and it would be some time before most households would have a radio, which was the first method of near-instantaneous communication.",
        "I will also point out that Germans seem more open or interested in other cultures/religions/languages, and in certain circles promoted free or independent thought and discussion about stuff like this. They are known for their interest in things like alchemy, hermetics, esoteric philosophy. Things like the printing press and lutheranism branch of christian religion started with a more radical/progressive mentality (for that time) to go against the catholic church and make their own bible in the german language, along with the luthers as a different religious philosophy. This promotes more independent thought and challenging old ideas. The printing press helped push more access to books and a good reason to write and publish your own works since it was easier to do so. The early exposure of their ideas in a written form, translated into other languages, really helped put them in the forefront of philsophical discussion. They have done a pretty good job of translating works from all kinds of foreign or \"exotic\" cultures.... alot of the ancient sanskrit texts from india were originally translated and appreciated by Germans first out of all the europeans. When I looked for translations of sanskrit texts, I was surprised to find that many of them were by Germans, and they seemed to have a fascination for the indian culture as well as \"the orient' of east asia. The persians also translated alot of indian sanskrit texts, which then were translated to either german or latin or english. Even the location of Germany being in the center of europe, along with it being several smaller countries before it merged, has helped it to be exposed to different cultures/religions/languages and incorporate some of these elements. I'm sure this all helped play a role in having so many artists, scientists and philosophers to come out of germany, or just promote independent thought and analysis.",
        "German's I find have experienced tend to be rather... excuse.. but Anal retentive... what I mean is that they don't listen and have a very fixed World view that is very introspective and unhealthy.,..my experience of psychology over 45 years of being involved in Mental Health is that there is a lot of Psychobabble that gives big words for bad behaviour that for the most part people choose to do. Please don't give me anal observations about past experiences... people from bad backgrounds can CHOOSE to make good decisions. We are all culpable for our choices.

        "wow, so many wrong answers in the comments the real answer is simply because Germany was the leader in almost all the sciences up until maybe the mid 20th century. the world would even publish papers in German, because that was the norm. So of course there's going to be a lot of Germs discovering things Now, I believe, the scientific language is French. Or it could be English but I don't remember hearing that. Scientific instruments and data are widespread now, so every country does something cool (Russia is working on Cloning, Mexico just cured HPV, etc) but France leads in agriculture studies and maybe a few other earth sciences. idk who cares, I was just scrolling my front page and this post was recommended and the first answer is 8 paragraphs or pretentious nonsense, and the next 5 are make believe, so just wanted to clarify",
        "There is a pattern in Europe were cultures were anti or pro-intellectual. In the west, particularly the UK, intellectuals were actually considered a lesser class than merchants. Capitalism was the arsenal of the growing Spanish, English, and other empires, and therefore merchants were the most important of people. Prussia and the German diaspora were less interested in establishing mercantile empires, and more focused on creating a unified German state. They were far less concerned with advancing the merchant class and more inclined to become thinkers and philosophers. German people outside of what we now call Germany were also (like the Jews and Romani) faced with opposition to entering certain artisan professions, which were often apprenticeship based, and were not given the same rights as native populations in the menial labor pool. They also kept their navies and merchant fleets rather small. Eastern Europe remained far closer to its feudal roots for much longer than western Europe did, and maintained their animosity and fear of Prussians and their military ambitions/history. Within Prussia, aristocrats were more rewarded for their studies of military history and other more \"rounded\" pursuits than simply enriching the German state. They viewed the strengthening of their culture and people as more important than establishing global trade empires, and improvement of the person became a cultural ideal more quickly than in other places in Europe. And - as in other places, and other people, and other times - their intellectual superiority eventually became part of their justification for thinking that they were *actually* superior. And what was the first act of this supposedly intellectually superior Reich? To tell all the intellectuals to get out of the lab and into the Army. Just like China did during the Cultural Revolution. All this has happened before... all this will happen again.",
        "Well. Part of it: There were a lot of famous non-German psychologists early on, but then a wee kerfuffle happened, things got mad okkers, the US and the Soviets decided that they really really liked these German freaks for some reason, bingo bongo Hans Asperger is the godfather of autism now, instead of Grunya Sukhareva. It's all very scientific."

Thinking can help frame the direction you want to take but you'll also need to take some action to get there. In addition, it turns out it's not just the thinking brain that plays out here. It turns out that the [gut sends quite a lot of information to the brain] and the [heart also influences the brain's electrical activity]. It seems that other non-verbal sources of information are a lot more important than we thought they were to tell us who we are and how our reality is at any given moment."

      "output": [
        "Because people forget power dynamics with the passage of time. Beforehand, the american left widely supported Israel precisely because it was seen as the smaller and less powerful country constantly struggling to survive. For the first 50 years of the 75 years this conflict has been raging, Israel was fighting the combined might of the entire Arab League, that desperately wanted to slaughter every single one of them. The older european generations grew up under the threat of palestinian attacks on european soil, theres so many of them that this wikipedia page subdivides them by countries. I can almost say with absolute certainty that if your country had a dedicated anti-terrorism unit pre-9/11, it was created to fight PLO sleeper cells in Europe from trying to target your country's jews. But over time, the conflict changes scope. In 1979, It is no longer Israel vs Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Palestine, and half the muslim world that ethnically cleansed all their jews and called for the destruction of the state where all thoses jews fled to. It is now Israel vs Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Palestine as Egypt makes a peace treaty. This is the way of the world as boomers remember the Israel-Arab conflict to have been, when there was a good chance for a second holocaust to have happened as the arab armies were so numerous compared to the jews that Israel had to conscript its mothers and daughters into combat positions to be capable of closing the gap. Suddenly its 1993 and 1994, when Palestine and Jordan make peace, respectively. The PLO puts down its arms for the first time and accepts a diplomatic solution to the conflict. This is what Gen X grew up with and still remember, for the first time the palestinians stopped being seen as a strictly homicidal and genocidal people that stop at nothing but the destruction of jews around the planet. It is now Israel vs Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran. The First and Second Intifadas erupt in 1987 and 2003. Israel brutally quashes them both down, ending with the blockade of Gaza. This is in the middle of the 9/11 world, where Americans at the time found a sympathetic ear for the Israeli plight. If you tuned in to CNN during the 2003 era, you world see weekly news of suicide bombings happening in Israel, with blown up supermarkets and grocery stores and public places, culminating with 42 suicide bombings in a single year, and news of palestinian child suicide bombers and blood curling rhetoric from the PLO and Hamas calling for the mass slaughter of every single jew on the planet being mainstream. It is only post 2003 that Israel managed to secure overwhelming military power, where the power dynamics became completely one-sided, it is only post-1993 that the Arab-Israeli conflict where 400 million arabs unilaterally declared war on 7 million jews became the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the focus is no longer on the *outside* arabs Syria and Lebanon were still threats, but the Arab Spring destroyed Syria as a potential threat to Israel and severely weakened Lebanon to the point the Lebanese Defense Forces became a joke. It is now Israel vs West Bank and Gaza, Iran and a weak Lebanon and a destroyed Syria. This is the world millenials still remember. We fast forward to 2014, Hezbollah has taken over Lebanon. It is a paramilitary organization representing Iran. Gaza has been deeply drained of its power and economy, as its been locked behind a blockade, the West Bank becomes more and more pacified as the Israelis divide it up and the PLO puts down its arms, the only opponents left become terror groups as the PLO refuses to engage in warfare. The fight is now between Israel vs Gaza (Hamas, Islamic Jihad, PFLP), Iran and Hezbollah, as Lebanon and Syria are out of the picture. This is the world Gen Z grew up with. We're in 2024. Israel is now fighting Gaza alone. It is now Israel vs Hamas, where Gazans are literally caught in the crossfire. It is no longer a weak desperate paranoid freshly-genocided 5 million strong Israel fighting the 240 million strong Arab League coalition, but the 9 million strong Israel crushing the 2.2 million strong Gaza. This is how Boomers and Zoomers see the war differently. Just like how the holocaust is a distant memory for many that might as well be relegated to the same era as the Boer war, many are growing up right in the middle of the conflict without understanding what happened in the past 30 years and how we got here. What boomers, gen x and millenials grew up with is far different than what zoomers grew up with.",
        "\"Why are boomers more pro-Israel than younger generations?\" Probably proximity to WWII veterans. They grew up with documentaries about the Holocaust that explicitly showed the victim's of the concertation camps and knew people who fought in Europe. For more modern generations it's more history than something that happened in living memory. As a consequence there's less guilt over the horror of WWII and Jews and more emphasis on the balance of Palestinian and Israeli interests/behavior.",
        "Interestingly, Gen Z is a lot more likely to deny the Holocaust, too. I think the answer is likely to do with media and government trust. Older generations are more likely to trust in their chosen media and political figures, which makes them more likely to follow particular media narratives whether or not they're accurate. Younger people are more likely to question media and be cynical, which means they're also more likely to dismiss things that are true without adequately looking into them, as long as it matches what their friends think. They're probably equally bad, but in slightly different ways.",
        "Gen X-er here. I think what you witness in your lifetime tends to skew you one way or another. Gen X and Boomers saw a long stretch during which Israel looked pretty reasonable: a country trying to defend itself. We were less aware of the dicey circumstances of its founding. For example, all I saw from my earliest memory of Israel in 1972 - the Black September massacre of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists - through the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin (when Israel really started to turn to shit) was Arab countries combining to destroy Israel, failing spectacularly, and losing territory to Israel, and repeating the cycle. For Boomers, that would go back to Nasser's attempts to destroy Israel in the 1950s. In between these wars, Israel made multiple attempts to cut peace deals, which inevitably fell through at the last minute when the Palestinian representatives got cold feet and walked away. Or so was the perception in the U.S. media. With the exception of the war crimes during the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the West Bank settlements, it looked to me, and to Boomers, that Israel was always on the defensive, a country surrounded by enemies, always making a good faith effort to make peace. We were less aware of questions surrounding the founding of Israel and the tactics the Israelis used to ghettoize the Palestinian population in the 1940s. As for the Palestinians? The massacre during the Munich Olympics in 1972 did the image of the Palestinians no favors - the image of that blurry hooded killer had stuck in my mind from the tender age of 6. We did not understand that Black September or Fatah did not necessarily represent Palestinians, not least because they lacked a functioning democracy. After Rabin's assassination in '95, the paranoid and uglier people in Israel gained control of the government, and included the most chauvinistic right wingers in their coalition. This is when the West Bank truly went to hell, and Gaza became an outdoor prison. Politicians like Ariel Sharon and Netanyahu sold out to hard-right nuts to further their careers. One could argue that Israel were the good guys between 1957 and 1995, but awful before and after that.",
        "I would strongly recommend taking a listen to [this webinar] Dr Shibley Telhami of the University of Maryland did at the Council on Foreign Relations. &#x200B; He outlines four factors that have caused a shift among younger progressive americans on the Israel Palestine issue: &#x200B; 1- They are less white and less male then any other subgroup- and women and people of color are more likely to sympathize with Palestinians &#x200B; 2- Social media use- higher social media use means that information young Americans recieve is different then the mainstream, traditional media. (To add my own example here, many of my peers follow Palestinian reporters working directly in Gaza, for example Plestia Alaqad) &#x200B; 3- Democrats have begun looking at the issue through a more social-justice influenced lense, vs Republicans looking at it through a realist foreign policy or bibilical lense. &#x200B; 4- For the past decade and a half, Israel has had a deeply conservative government led by Netanyahu. While older voters might distiguish between Netanyahu's government and the israeli government/state as a whole, younger voters only know Netanyahu's policy goals as that of Israel as a whole",
        "They grew up before the Palestinians switched from their Egyptian-style propaganda campaign to their South African style campaign. Pre-1990, the Palestinians focused on their blood right to the land and the annihilation of Jews. It worked for Egypt in 1956, it should work in Palestine, right? Wrong. The Israelis also had a blood right to the land, so the Westerners could back them in good conscience. But in the 1990s, the Palestinians chief supporter in the USSR collapsed, and that was a serious blow to their military capabilities. But South Africa showed that racism was now a weak point in Western support. Hamas keyed in on this first, and leveraged the Palestinian diaspora to spin a new story about racism.

You are not immune to propaganda.",
        "&#x200B; Given the question doesn't really lend itself to objective citation and the reasoning behind one's feelings (i.e. being pro/against something) is mostly speculation, the confirmation bias and echo chamber article is the most responsive you can get. However... Because they probably remember the meaning behind the phrase, \"from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.\" (Slight /s, and citations all led to p2p books/links). That, and boomers largely understand that Islamic ideals (not the people, just its teachings, values, laws, etc., which are malleable and can be separated from the person) are substantively completely at odds with not just the USA specifically but all Western nations. That isn't to necessarily say one is better than the other. Merely that they are contradictory ideals, and while one would allow for the other. The other would preclude the one; often by threat of death or conversion. The U.S.A. specifically, and Western nations broadly, are founded on Judeo-Christian ideals and individualism which is an ubiquitously accepted reality. And Islam, despite being a derivation of the former aside from individualism, is directly opposed to core values of Western nations and their non-Islamic religions (nuanced arguments can of course be had; just a generalization). The older generation has had the opportunity to witness how Muslim nations (which can easily be conflated with Palestine specifically) have interacted with Western nations and how Israel has interacted therewith by comparison (and effectively became or started as a Western nation itself).  Another aspect is that Gen Z, through no fault of their own, is instructed by the preceding generations' age of teachers. Most of whom have a glaringly biased view favoring Islamic and Middle-Eastern agendas or in the alternative getting too tied up in school politics to go against the norm even if they disagree. And humans have a great tendency to believe in and defend the first agreeable perspective they are given. Seeking not to understand counter-arguments. Rather, to build up and entrench oneself behind their initial beliefs for fear of admitting they were wrong. The great bane of man is the rarity of genuine humility. Confirmation bias at play.  Slight segue: While favoring either side based on a prejudiced yet ungrounded narrative or because of your adherence to a religion is, in my unhumble and arrogant opinion, stupid. I'd posit to each human of U.S./Western citizenship, \"which nation (though some would argue that one isn't really a nation) is an ally. Which nation maintains a system of laws and moral (read: religious) teachings that at least allow for, if not support, your nation's existence and way of being. Which nation has aligned itself with the global goals and human rights initiatives that are largely agreed upon by Westerners. And thusly, which one would be more prudent for the U.S. to defend, if it was forced to take any stance at all.\" If the response is not Israel, then the respondent is (generally) either a liar, a fool, or Muslim.  It doesn't matter whose view is right or wrong in the moral sense. Eventually, it'll just be a note in a history book anyhow. Rather, from a system standpoint, it's like using a system running entirely off Windows, demanding it to download a bunch of programs from MacOS and wondering why the pieces don't fit... because they're pre-programmed not to.  Back on track: Summarily, Gen-Z (and millennials who are themselves a part of the problem) have been taught to think a certain way. With the lies and nonsense surrounding the wars in the Middle East and bad publicity that ensued thereafter, every \"smart\" kid bashes the prior generations' perceived evils (that he regurgitates from his first instructor/source material) until he himself is humbled or dead. Wrongful persecution of Muslims still has a bad taste in many people's mouths leading to over-tolerance of the negative teachings found therein. And as others have cited to, the perceived \"David\" role of Palestine, and Israel  As Charlie Chaplin might say, they have been taught what to do, what to think, and what to feel. Though, he might change it up for them and also say, they feel too much and think too little.  But that's just my own subjective view on a question without a clear citable answer.

If a person has been paying attention for the last like 30 years you've watched over and over again as Palestinians shot indiscriminate rockets into Israel nonstop. Usually shooting from hospitals and playgrounds and schools. Why do they do that? So they can create a narrative and propaganda.

We learned so much about colonialism and the harm it caused, and then see it play out in real time with Israel and are supposed to just give a free pass? I\u2019m just not sure why I\u2019m supposed to support the ethnic cleansing of Arabs. Israel has no intention of living in peace with the Arab inhabitants of the land yet points fingers at the other side for wanting to destroy Israel. We are supposed to pick sides when both are being assholes I guess. I don\u2019t think the current war is about Hamas, that\u2019s just the excuse to murder as many Palestinians as they can.

For example when the Achille Lauro was highjacked by the PLO in 1985, and a highly dangerous 69-year-old US citizen named Leon Klinghoffer, who while confined to a wheelchair was shot and dumped overboard.   But then I remember what Israel did to the USS Liberty in 1967, when they 'accidentally' attacked the Liberty, flying the At Sea Flag, in International waters, with torpedo boats and aircraft over a couple of hours. Killing 37 US Personnel, wounding more than 100 and doing several million dollars worth of damage to the ship.   My personal opinion is that we should tell both groups to go fuck themselves."

        "According to [Crenshaw], who introduced the concept back in 1989, it\u2019s not simply that people who are part of two marginalized groups face more oppression than people who are part of one marginalized group. Intersectionality is about a complex of oppression. (A woman of color does not face the oppression that a person of color faces in a racist context _plus_ the oppression a woman faces in a sexist context, but her unique identity as a woman of color in a racist sexist context exposes her to a new/unique complex of oppression. It\u2019s that the situation becomes different, analyzing it requires different perspectives, and solutions offered to counteract oppression faced by group 1 may not be helpful or might even be harmful to group 2. If this notion is indeed obvious to you now, then it\u2019s thanks to the concept of intersectionality. It showed that a lot of the analyses before the concept was introduced were severely limited and biased. To this day, I think it\u2019s quite difficult to really integrate an intersectional lens in studies.",
        "That is an incorrect understanding of the term. Intersectionality refers to the empirically demonstrable fact that people occupying multiple marginalized groups actually face *more* and *different* discrimination than you would expect just by adding together sources of marginalization. This was proven quite decisively by looking at data of businesses who sought to correct racism in hiring practices, and who successfully brought their staffing numbers back into alignment with the expected number of black workers and female numbers--*but not black female workers*. On a deeper conceptual level, you might imagine that different communities offer different forms of support to marginalized people--so long as you are the *right kind* of marginalized person. Within black communities, there is substantially more homophobia [1]; conversely, anti-black racism is sometimes cited as a problem within LGBTQ communities, see e.g.:[2]. A black person can find solidarity among black people; a gay person can find solidarity with other gay people; a gay black person has *less* access to *both* of these sources of social support, even though they deal with *more* marginalization.",
        "Let's try a thought experiment Imagine you are a person responsible for the city's response to the massive influx of people running away from something (e.g. war refugees or a neighboring city was flooded and people are moving to your city). What kind of things and services should you have ready for these people? . . . . . . Knowing about intersectionality, you probably thought about some general things (e.g. food, shelter, general medical help), some stuff for women (e.g. menstruation products), maybe some stuff for disabled. Now take intersectionality even further and try to split the general population into further groups. . . . . For example, a certain percentage of people would be HIV positive, and you would need to manage that. Some people will be suffering from other chronic issues, e.g. cancer, hepatitis. A number of women will be in different stages of pregnancy. There will be homophobic people having to live next to gay people, etc, etc. This is the strength and practical application of intersectionality. It recognises that the standard approach (e.g prepare basic food and medicine, write a policy for all) in many cases does not work, as it would leave a huge part of the population behind. It shows itselfs in many cases: e.g. how we design cars, how we build our cities, how we write policies"

      "output": [
        "This isn't *exactly* related to your question, but here's an interesting article concerning [\"good death\" and its impact on the surviving spouse]. A \"good death\" is one featuring physical comfort, social support, acceptance, adequate medical care, and minimized psychological distress. Using survey data of individuals aged 65+, the author analyzes how death quality shapes the psychological adjustment of the surviving spouse six months post-death. She focuses on death-related factors contributing to yearning, intrusive thoughts, anger, and loss-related anxiety. ***Yearning*** was increased by two factors: 1. having positive and/or high quality interactions with the dying partner in the final days, and 2. the death being painful. ***Intrusive thought****s* were increased by two factors: 1.) being present for the death, and 2. the death being painful. ***Anger*** was increased by two factors: 1.) having negative and/or low-quality interactions with the dying partner in the final days, and 2. physician negligence (i.e., believing the doctor is to blame for the death). ***Loss-related anxiety*** was increased by one factor: the death being painful. Given the population studied, we can't generalize all that much, but the insights are food for thought. Let's explore your examples (a child dying in a hit-and-run by a distracted driver and a child dying from leukemia) assuming the article above is accurate. Note that we aren't talking about how bad that death itself is, but rather how difficult it is for the survivors to psychologically adjust. In the hit-and-run scenario, the survivors had no interactions with the dying person immediately prior to death. Whether they had seen them recently or not may make a difference, but they wouldn't have known the death was coming, perhaps rendering the time spent together moot. The death was also very likely painful (or at least imagined as such by the survivors). This means the survivors will likely experience all four symptoms: yearning, intrusive thoughts, anger, and loss-related anxiety. Notably, they're getting a \"double dose\" of anger as both contributing factors apply. In the leukemia scenario, the survivors likely spent a lot of time in hospice with the dying person. Leukemia is also not particularly painful (it's often described as intense aching, although it can get bad). And even if the disease itself causes any pain, the dying person is often pumped full of pain killers in a hospice context. Ultimately, if you know you're dying of cancer, minimizing pain and being surrounded by loved ones become top priorities. This means the survivors will likely experience one symptom: yearning. If they happened to present for the death, they may additionally experience intrusive thoughts. So based on the framework provided in the linked article, the unexpected/avoidable/sudden death results in worsened psychological adjustment during the bereavement period. While yearning is not fun, it generally lessons with time. Anger, intrusive thoughts, and anxiety are much harder to shake, much more distressing, and may require professional intervention to address. Again, this is based on one article and I'm not a death/grief person, so take this all with a grain of salt. The article largely concerns old people who knew death was coming (heart disease, cancer, etc.). An unexpected death is a different ballgame and will have its own set of symptoms, especially if's your child rather than your partner. At the end of the day, the point I wanted to get across was that different forms of death can produce different symptoms of grief, some easier to process than others. A question I have is the role of *pain*. The author above found that pain is a contributing factor to 3/4 of the symptoms she described. I'm curious as to why, for instance, the death being painful would make you yearn for the person more, but wouldn't make you more angry."

For instance, that schools are designed to shake money out of your pockets, not to educate or inspire you. Of course, they're harder on people prone to anxiety, too. Your interest in art may come back, or it may not. I think probably the best thing you can do for yourself is to focus on something else. Start progressing your career in a direction away from art, even if it's just an entry-level job you don't care about. Right now the pressure to produce art is compounding with your anxiety to make art the last thing you want to do. It's only when you take the pressure off yourself that you will be able to see if you still even like art.",

        "From a behavioral standpoint, art was once inspiring and rewarding to you, but the experience of art school paired art with punishment, in the form of anxiety, guilt, shame, pressure, etc. So the behavior of creating art that was once enjoyable is now aversive. As another posted said, it would really do you well to take your focus off art and allow yourself time to find inspiration in other ways. It could lead you back to art or it could not. However, continuing to try and force yourself to do art when you no longer find enjoyment from it will only continue the cycle of punishment. You also describe what might be considered learned helplessness. Where you have been punished so much, without any means of escape, that you become helpless and basically freeze because there seems to be no other alternative for escaping said punishment. We can convince ourselves that we are in this state when we don't feel like there is any other options for us. There is a reason that some professions have higher rates of suicide, because people tend to get stuck and don't see any way out. I'm not sure if you're there yet, but I would encourage you to look at finding other ways of getting by, or even find some other hobbies that bring you joy. Finally, it might be helpful to seek out some therapy to help you get past what you are experiencing. I'd suggest cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). If you are having too much anxiety to seek out a therapist, there is an ACT workbook that might be helpful called \"Get out of you're mind and into your life\" by Steven C Hayes.

        "What are moderate political views? Are you allowing MSNBC and Fox News to determine what is left and right or are you applying a different framework? Moderate political views are an illusion. When they exist, it's either due to ignorance or apathy. Further, people who have moderate views are often inconsistent with themselves because again, moderate political values are usually a sign of low information or apathy. The closest someone can have to a moderate political view is in the discussion of how authoritarian and fiscally liberal the government should be. But you'll never hear a politician or a talking head discuss the benefits and risks in those trade offs in a way that's intellectually honest. The problem is that in the United States, \"fiscal conservatism\" became synonymous with lowering taxes regardless of whether or not it would be economically prudent or responsible. \"Socially liberal/fiscally conservative\" became \"well, racism exists and it sucks but we should keep on engaging in economic policy that makes it worse\". Because many people struggle to assert themselves and don't identify as being an extremist, more people identify themselves as being independent, moderate, or centrist because they are concerned with how they are perceived. Sometimes that's due to how criticisms of leftist ideology are usually replete with mischaracterizations and stereotypes and nuance gets lost. Cohesive ideology and complex systems have tons of nuance. So, to Middle America, someone who understands why protesters who protest systemic police brutality and how when those protests end in riots, people who are sympathetic to the rioters are perceived as being supportive of rioting rather than just someone who understands sociology. I think the best analogy that can be used to describe moderates is how they are similar to how adults entering corporate America believe that their colleagues and bosses know what they're doing and are competent while slowly realizing how they're often barely making ends meet. Many moderates simply believe that there are people who know what they're doing at all ends and that simply isn't true.",
        "There are multiple facets in this question which could be discussed. To answer it in the most direct manner possible, the vast majority of US voters are what we would term \"moderate\", in the sense that they are located in the middle of the political spectrum. Generally we broadly call this the median voter theory, which was invented in 1957, but holds up exceedingly well today for most purposes. Voters aren't perfectly distributed towards the middle (partisanship is a thing), but most generally place themselves near the \"middle\" of US politics. Or to be more specific to the generally accepted mechanism, US politics move so that most people are around the middle, with peoples ideological beliefs being generally stable. For that reason, we also generally observe that when a party nominates a \"moderate\" politician, they on average perform better in elections. So in short, the answer to your question is *very common*. Now there are other facets of the question we could dig into. What exactly is a \"moderate\" ideology? Conceptually it doesn't tell us much on it's own, it refers instead to the relative position the ideology has in the US spectrum, that between conservatives and liberals. That doesn't mean (contrary to the other stupid comment) that it's not a real ideology, it's just a label. Ideologically we can describe some very common positions to the US \"moderate\". They support democracy, they support a limited state that they generally don't wish to interact with much, they are fairly religious (compared to the rest of the west) and wish for the government to respect that choice, they generally don't support large tax increases or large tax decreases and like the current size of the US government, they want to maintain the idea of the nuclear family but aren't particularly married to any specific notion of what that is, they believe the US should play an active role internationally (without military intervention), they support some level of immigration etc. etc. I could go on. Please don't listen to that other terrible comment. It's not social science, its a mesh of partisan ideas more reflective of OP's own political position than anything to do with US politics."

Thus, by definition, antidepressants are not particularly effective against treatment-resistant depression.

        "I copied and pasted a comment I made a few months ago several hypothesis for childhood amnesia (they aren't mutually exclusive) : The ongoing maturation of brain areas, like the hippocampus, and for episodic memory prefrontal and medial temporal cortex. Episodic memory (which includes autobiographic memory) starts developping from early childhood to adolescence Autobiographic memory is build upon episodic memory (around 6 yo) which has a immature state (event memory) that starts to \"appears\" and develops around 3 to 6 yo. It's when kids can predict what they did today, will do next, like tomorrow or predict the chronological steps of a routine (brushing teeths, being read a story and going to bed for instance). Autobiographic memory may rely on language, so it may be difficult to consciously recall stuff from when we hadn't access to verbal concepts to memorize or categorise things. Another hypothesis is that our senses / body is undergoing a lot of changes, and the memories from early childhood cannot be recalled properly. By being taller, being more accurate with our senses etc, an experience from early childhood (like visiting a place) cannot be recalled properly when revisiting it because a lot of the properties of the experience have changed. That being said, people may have memories from early childhood. However, in some cases it's hard to tell if it's a false memory that has been built upon hearing a story told by others, or constructed with present representations of one's childhood. Non declarative memory (ie non verbal memory), like procedural memory, exists in babies. Learning to walk, to touch, to associate a movement with a consequences, involves memory and can be seen as early as a few months after being born. It's very hard to study babies though, so it's possible that these processes exist even before this age, but we haven't found a way to study it. The computer memory is not an accurate example of human memory, while it can be used to make some metaphors it really works in a lot of different ways. Computers are object that store information, like you store information in a piece of paper when you write things. When you pick up the paper, the words haven't changed. Human memory doesn't work like that, it reconstructs mnesic information by involving several neural pathways related to the memory, it doesn't store a 'photograph' of an information like a computer would. Since your brain develops through time, and your neural pathways aren't fixed, your memories may be affected by it. This is especially true in childhood when the brain is undergoing maturation."

Humans tend to want to maintain the safety of themselves and their group, and to keep other groups separate and at bay. If we would see another group as a threat to health and safety of our own group, we would act aggressively or avoid that group. A fine instinct when it comes to surviving in the untamed wilderness. However, not so helpful when we become a globalized society. That mistrust of the other groups becomes bias or prejudicial attitudes that trigger the same aggression."

This causes a heightened sensitivity to stress responses, difficulty with emotional regulation, impulsivity and a slew of other symptoms. While I am not personally sure of the science behind mindfulness, one could infer that the shrinking of the amygdala allows for easier emotional regulation, higher stress tolerance, and the ability to manage impulses with greater ease.

I believe research suggests that the experience of stress increases the volume of the amygdala. I've not read any studies about mindfulness therapy changing the size of any brain structure, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's something people have looked at in research. I think the idea is that smaller amygdala is associated with less stress, but it's safer to say they're correlated and that there isn't a causal relationship."

Then the repair begins, though a new fire may break out . Usually in a few weeks, skills have been developed to prevent new fires, so we can continue the repairs.

That's quite straightforward right? But let's take Mr B. His goals are to improve his relationship with his elderly mother. Throughout therapy it quickly becomes apparent that Mr B has zero consideration for the fact his mother has dementia, the professional observes that much of the apparent relationship conflict arises from frustrations from Mr B when his mother fails to remember previous conversations and information. Mr B's is a bit more vague and doesn't have any specific agreements with his professional about how to confront issues, so the professional has a number of potential options: 1. Educate about the issue 2. Ask questions 3. Request opportunity to provide feedback.",

Sometimes it immediately leads to defensiveness even if its said as gently as possible - that's ok. Sometimes they acknowledge the issue but feel they can't change yet.

      "output": [
        "I'm sorry you've had such a string of invalidating experiences with the mental health system. It sounds like it's been a real nightmare. I'll try and answer your question to the best of my ability, but you should know that I can't speak for the mental health community in general, much less every individual practitioner, so the best I can offer on why you've been treated the way you have will be some educated guesses. We have known for a long time that mental illness can be the result of trauma and abuse. If you use both a broad definition of \"trauma\" and a broad definition of \"mental illness,\" then you could say that we've known from the beginning (that is, the era of Freud and Jung) that most mental illness is rooted in some kind trauma. Over the decades, we've been in a gradual process of zeroing in on exactly how that happens, what kind of traumas cause lasting symptoms, and what kind of symptoms are caused by trauma, but we still have a lot to learn. One of the trickiest things to understand about the relationship between trauma and mental illness is the fact that there isn't a perfect 1:1 correlation. If you exposed three individuals to the same trauma at the same age, you could well find that one of them developed a severe and long-lasting mental illness, another developed some milder, easily-managed symptoms, and the third developed no notable symptoms at all. We're still not totally sure why that happens, but our working theory right now is that it has to do with individual vulnerabilities in neurochemistry and temperament, as well as things like what kind of support resources the individual has access to. So that might explain part of why your experiences with the mental health system have felt so invalidating-- if they were trying to explain that individual factors moderate how your brain and body cope with trauma, that could certainly sound a lot like blaming you for it. It's also worth noting that there seems to be a stronger correlation between certain kinds of mental illness and certain kinds of trauma, and less correlation with others. Obviously, PTSD has the strongest link to trauma-- in order to get the diagnosis, you must have experienced a serious trauma. Some other diagnoses, like certain attachment disorders and certain personality disorders, have a pretty strong correlation as well, where if you have trauma you're more likely to get those diagnoses, and if you have one of those diagnoses, chances are pretty good that you've experienced some trauma. On the other end of the scale, there are some diagnoses like Bipolar Disorder or Schizophrenia which as far as we know have very little correlation with trauma. If you've been seeking treatment for disorders like that, it's possible that your practitioners have tended to look for non-trauma explanations because as far as we know, trauma isn't the main cause for those issues. One other thing to consider about psychiatrists in particular is that by and large (at least in the US and Canada), a psychiatrist's job is to prescribe medication for mental health issues. There's a whole thing about how they're the only mental health providers who are allowed to prescribe, and as a consequence it becomes 90-100% of their job. Psychiatrists have a deserved reputation for looking at chemical causes and chemical solutions first, and other possible causes and solutions second or not at all. It's kind of like that old carpenter's saying \"When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\" You might be able to find more effective trauma support from a psychologist or trauma-focused counselor, if you are able to find one of those in your community. It might still take a few tries to find one who feels like a good fit, but you'll likely get a better hit rate with a talk-based therapist than with a psychiatrist. Good luck."

        "**Gender identity itself is a composite of multiple \"sub-identities\":** * Intrinsic Gender Identity * Gender Role * Gender Expression According to Serano, these 3 forms of gender identity exist independently of each other. Hypatia , Volume 24 , Issue 3: Special Issue: Transgender Studies and Feminism: Theory, Politics, and Gendered Realities , Summer 2009 , pp. 200 - 205 DOI: Within our daily lives, we can witness this in form of women performing traditionally male labours, while still identifying as woman (Intrinsic Identity and Gender Role clashing). We can witness this in various subcultures (The concept of \"tomboys\" and \"butch lesbians\", a woman who dresses and behaves as a man traditionally should) (Identity and Expression clashing). The idea of \"I'm a man, so I don't wear a skirt\" pertains not to gender identity, but gender expression. Potentially, to your gender role as a way to advertise what role in society you fulfil by dressing the part. However, being a man does not dictate you cannot wear a skirt. **For Intrinsic gender identity itself, I'll depart from social science and onto neuropsychology.** *Burke et al (2017)* found was found that after controlling for sexual/romantic orientation, culture, etc... there exist a difference between transgender people (with physical dysphoria, before transitioning medically) and cisgender people when it comes to neural structures. These differences manifest primarily in neuro-motor regions, regions corresponding for sensory processing. Basically, places where the brain communicates with the body. The differences are that these regions appear \"underdeveloped\", as if not being exercised. It's not \"male brain\" or \"female brain\", it's \"my brain doesn't get the responses from my body that it expects\" vs \"my body looks and behaves like my brain expects.\" *Khorashad et al (2021)* later investigated these findings, finding that these neural differences disappear upon taking gender-confirming cross-sex hormonal therapy. Or at the very least, minimize. Meaning, it appears that the weakened connections become exercised and reinforced. This explains why trans people who have medically transitioned no longer exhibit these patterns, and also tracks with reports of gender dysphoria easing over time even though the person does not culturally/socially pass. **Two methods of action are proposed:** a) body feels and behaves as the brain's \"internal blueprint\" expects it to: hormone levels are correct, the proper genes are expressed now, the right proteins and shape and function. Just like doing exercises reinforces neural pathways, so does the body responding like the brain expects it to does the same. b) Hormones directly bind with hormone receptors in the brain, encouraging the formation of new neural structures. B would explain what some trans people call \"hormonal/endocrine dysphoria.\" Or rather the euphoria from being on hormones even before physical changes set in. The two mechanisms proposed are not exclusive, but yet to be determined. Burke, S.M., Manzouri, A.H. & Savic, I. Structural connections in the brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Sci Rep 7, 17954 (2017). Khorashad, B.S., Manzouri, A., Feusner, J.D. et al. Cross-sex hormone treatment and own-body perception: behavioral and brain connectivity profiles. Sci Rep 11, 2799 (2021). ****** **Now, why does this neurological difference occur?** ****** Swaab, D. F., & Garcia-Falgueras, A. (2009). Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Functional Neurology, 24(1), 17\u201328. In this cited paper, Swaab et al studied people with a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Androgen Insensitivty syndrome causes testosterone (and other androgen) hormones to have failure binding to their appropriate receptors, or for those receptors to provide a lesser signal than they should. The consequence of AAS can range from underdeveloped testes and penis with gynecomastia to having a vagina with gonads that are neither testicles nor ovaries. It has been found by Swaab et al that depending on which specific androgens are blocked, gender identity varies: Total AAS led to a person to become a cisgender intersex woman, whereas partial AAS led to a transgender intersex man. By observing this, Swaab et al demonstrate that gender identity is likely controlled by how the brain interacts with hormone levels during foetal and perhaps early childhood development, independent of nurture. This can be caused by less-extreme forms of genetic disorders that affects hormone processing, and it's also possible for such disorders to be \"localized\" - the genes are there, working... but the other genes regulating the expression of the genes regulating testosterone receptor proteins might be locally dysfunctional, causing too much/too little exposure, affecting gender identity. ******** **As seen above, gender identity is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be changed. What about sex? Well - let's consider what sexual dimorphism actually is!** ******** one can read any Graduate level biology textbook regarding human sexual dimorphism. There, they would learn that gonadal differentiation is initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. This singular gene determines if your gonads develop into ovaries or testicles. The rest of the Y chromosome acts to regulate the function of testicles, and to assist in its healthy development. The rest of human sexual differentiation is initiated by the gonads themselves - gonads produce sex hormones: estrogens, androgens and progesterons. These estrogens, androgens and progesterons then bind with their respective receptors (which, barring androgen receptors - which are found on the X chromosome - are found scattered on 6 and 14 and 17 somatic chromosomes. Somatic chromosomes are the same in men and women), altering gene expression. This altered gene expression is drawn primarily from somatic chromosomes, and is found in both men and women. Human sexual differentiation, therefore - using graduate level biology: Presence or absence of SRY gene decides if you get testicles or ovaries Ovaries/Testicles develop, potentially failing due to genetic disorders. Assuming they don't fail. Ovaries/Testicles produce an abundance of either androgens, or estrogens (with progesterone becoming relevant after puberty mostly) These sex hormones act on hormone receptors, which are primarily governed by somatic chromosomes (ergo: same in XX and XY) These receptors alter gene expression This gene expression causes healthy development of gonads, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics. Therefore, if you read it - you find that sexual differentiation is dictated by endocrine levels (barring things like disorders caused by doubling of X chromosome and gonadal function). Therefore, a woman, using purely biological terms - is a person whose gene expression is primarily dictated by estrogen and progesterone levels. If you care about reproduction, you add the presence of functioning testes or ovaries. But people can live full lives without either, and many women need hysterectomy in order to survive due to cancer or genetic disorders. **Therefore, a transgender woman who is on a strict HRT regiment whose gonads were removed is functionally no different from an androgen-insensitive woman.**",
        "Per Kohlberg and many other early sources, gender is a concept that is come to be understood in early childhood on the basis of several superficial characteristics such as hair and clothing style, toys and play style. Kohlberg, L., & Maccoby, E. E. (1966). The development of sex differences. EE Maccoby (Ed.). (I can't link that because this source does not appear online that I can find). However, here's another early one that experimentally studies it in children: As they describe, following Kohlberg, the acquisition of \"gender constancy\" is when children finally understand gender at the conceptual level, understanding that it does not necessarily depend on dress and other superficials, because many of these are of course culturally dependent. But a big part of the concept of gender deals with social roles. Cultures have differing ideas about the roles of men and women, but importantly, they assign gender roles. Here's a paper on that: Note that it is a study of \"attitudes\" about gender roles. This emphasizes again the psychological/conceptual aspect of gender. In contrast, sex is biological. Epigenetic factors influence the development of one's reproductive anatomy and body morphology. Note that I mention epigenetics here because it isn't as simple as whether you have XX and XY chromosomes. Gene interactions and environmental influences will also come into play (not to mention chromosomal issues like XXY, fragile X, etc). Clearly there's a large correlation between one's biological sex and gender identity, but because of the complex epigenetic, environmental, and cultural inputs into the development of one's self-concept (including self-gender concept), we see the emergence of exceptions to that correlational rule. In fact, even a perusal of the medical literature makes it increasingly clear that what were once considered sex differences in certain diseases may actually be gender differences, and its become important to ask patients both their sex and their gender in order to effectively track this.

        "Fair warning: I'm a psychologist, but I'm not in any way specialized in infant development, so take this with a grain of salt. At four months old, your baby isn't processing high-level concepts like \"home\" yet, and won't be for quite some time. He's still developing the ability to understand what he sees and recognize things he's seen before. Over the next year or so, he'll start to develop a linguistic understanding of the word \"home\" which he will associate with your home because that's how the word will be used. The more complicated, adult understanding of the concept of home will take a lot longer to develop (honestly, a lot of adolescents and adults are still evolving their understandings of the deeper meaning of \"home\"). Of course, parallel with that development is the question of where he will feel most comfortable. Comfort with a situation comes from having repeated positive experiences in that situation and minimal bad experiences. As long as both his daycare and home are safe, nurturing environments that are responsive to his needs, chances are good that he will feel comfortable and \"at home\" in both places, and that's exactly what you want! That generalizable safe base is the foundation upon whiich he will build his resilience."

Generally reality is nuanced and thinking in black and white prevents someone from seeing the world as it is. I\u2019ll give an example. My partner didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d before leaving for work Cognitive reappraisal- maybe they were in a rush Splitting- fucking narcissist, they never gave a fuck about my feelings Black and white thinking- If they loved me they would have said \u201cI love you\u201d before leaving.

Just to further complicate your question is becomes very difficult to judge the quality of a persons change, it seems intuitive that someone being nihilistic about climate change might not be great, but then again perhaps for some individuals it could actually be empowering \"the world's stuffed but I'm going to do my best\" I'm stretching a bit beyond my expertise as I'm a behaviourist, but my understanding is a reappraisal is more about the emotions and implications of a fact, whereas acceptance is more about not engaging in denial/rejecting reality - they aren't really different options so much as different steps of a process e.g. acceptance = I accept that climate change is happening reappraisal = I am thinking differently about the implications / my response to climate change &#x200B; Acceptance is actually a very special interest topic of mine because its fairly obvious a subject on the surface however the more you try and understand and define what is actually mean by acceptance the more strange and elusive the concept gets. At the moment I consider acceptance/denial as more of a sliding scale than a binary response. e.g. people rarely outright 'deny' reality (well ok they kinda do, but moving on) but will tend to \"dabble\" with denial, e.g. entertain ideas that minimize a fact and so on."

This is something that is simply outside of his purview. As I'm sure you already know, Freud was influential because he pointed the study of mental illness in the direction of a medical explanation instead of a religious one. That said, you can be a paradigm shifter and still be a man of your time. His time and model did not accommodate asexuality. If you personally find his theories useful or interesting, make of them what you will. It does make me wonder which cherished models of our own time will be discarded.",
        "Here's how: it doesn't. It doesn't even explain the majority of other sexualities nor how women experience and engage in sex. That's because he wrote everything from his perspective as a straight non-asexual man in the early 1900s and didn't scientifically test his theories. Asexuality is most likely a natural variation of human sexuality, just like homosexuality, bisexuality, etc. Asexual people live lives as fulfilling as anyone else. Also worth pointing out that asexuality doesn't mean not wanting to have sex (which has historically been classified as a mental health disorder), it means someone does not experience sexual attraction. It has nothing to do with libido either. Please do not use Freud to inform you about any sexuality. I am asexual, and have a master's in psychology, and this view of asexuality is not only offensive but just really ignorant."

Any CBT style therapist that will just go in and automatically refute thoughts is not doing justice to the model, and largely some of the reasons why people have negative associations with CBT. Cognitive Behavioral principles indicate that thoughts, feelings, and actions all get affected by mental illness, and it's important to carefully pay attention to the interplay between all of these to truly understand how changing one of these dimensions might help. It's not just a hyperfocus on disproving thoughts. It's definitely not trying to change your thoughts for thoughts that the therapist thinks are rational. The whole concept behind socratic questioning is to help the client evaluate their current thinking, the costs and benefits of these beliefs, and to help them question it on their own, as a skill the client can practice and improve at. More than anything it's about changing the relationship with your thoughts, feelings, and actions to help manage or respond to mental illness. Even in a case where something thinks is true, we can also think about how thinking in that specific manner affects the rest of the system. How does it affect their feelings, how does it affect what they end up doing? But again, thats where other principles of CBT come in. Guided discovery to help the client identify the personal meaning ascribed from experiences is a necessary step to never skip."

Surveys (including the Census) are more likely to split asking about Latino identity into a separate race and ethnicity question. In some cases, this matches people's understanding of their race. There are many people who are from or have ancestry in Latino countries yet consider themselves to be white. But in other cases, this does not match people's understandings. There are many people who think of their race as Latino because they are what could be called mestizo in other countries and so they would not count themselves as white. So they put their race as \"other.\" One explanation can also be due to differences in how people see race in the US versus many Latino countries. There are many Latino people who are considered white in their home countries but are not necessarily considered so in the US. A larger proportion of the US Latino population is 2nd or 3rd generation. They may be more likely to put their race as other than their parents would be.

        "Not sure why this might be thought not psychology related (interested in an explanation tho). Seems to me this is exactly what psy should be good at explaining. One factor is the psychology of Internet communications which are distinct from f2f in some important ways. People behave in disinhibited ways online that they wouldn't do or say offline. There's a substantial body of work on that topic in itself. The felt sense can all too readily be \"this is fiction\" or \"a 'virtual' setting = it isn't real so doesn't matter\" or just the opportunity to say things without (apparent) repercussions or fx (like an emotional hit and run). Amongst other things. Also, a lot of people are pretty stupid. Even clever people can be stupid and thoughtless. There's also the transactional style and process - if people are seemingly invited to join with a particular perspective, they are quite likely to. Plus there may be humour involved that you don't find funny. Child abuse isn't funny but adults recognising exasperation with a younger person can be. The joke can be in seeing one of the participants doing something outrageous (like hitting a child) and we laugh because it presents jeopardy we experience from a position of safety (pretty much the definition of humour) much as we might laugh at Bart or Homer being outrageous in the Simpsons. A lot of stand up comedy has become based around this principle. Plus, making very strong statements is powerful and appealing, including disguising actual horrible attitudes as humour to do it. And that's easily replicable. Which is what makes a meme become discoverable and gain attention. Trump uses that all the time not caring whether people agree, just confident he can get a reaction that will take him up the algorithm. Angry engagement also promotes what one is angry about cos the Internet doesn't care about emotional valency (whether a thing is positive or negative). So a lot of psy factors at play. This is just a sampling I think.",
        "Hard to give you an answer. I don't think your question has a lot to do with psychology. It makes me think about 'identification with the agressor', a defense mechanism rooted in psychoanalysis where people internalize agression. For each commenter there could be a huge variety of reason, ranging from 'it's a bot' to generational/political bias, to 'it has to do with their specifics (way of thinking, culture, experiences)'. People aren't monolithic and there might not be something special going in their brain when expressing their views online. The skit you linked is also very stereotypical and has a 'comical' aspect : young girl being disrespectful and using technology, old woman with a southern accent being authoritarian. The target audience of this skit seems aimed to a generation where physical punishment wasn't uncommon. I honestly think that in this case it might be the kind of splitting content we see more and more online with strong intergroup bias : 'old school parenting' vs 'kids these days are disrepectful' and.or 'liberals being laxist parents' vs 'conservatives being authoritarian parents'. In the end, both extremes aren't good forms of parenting. Child abuse is unhealthy though, there's more than enough evidence to condemn it.",
        "So I think there is a lot to unpack from your question. Firstly a bit of a boring 'internet' answer but its likely that many comments are intended to be proactive or to use a non-technical term 'badass' its difficult to judge whether such comments are genuine - in the sense that people do condone that behaviour - or are simply careless with their comments. In terms of the much bigger picture child abuse is a very complex topic. This is by no means a condoning statement however its important to consider than in much of the history Western Societies children were essentially considered the sole property of their parents (and the father the owner of the family) in that perspective child abuse almost doesn't even exist as a concept. Now the reason I bring that up is after approx 100 years of progress we are now at a place where we recognize that ethically parents in fact have responsibilities and obligations to children rather than own them. But I think its fair to say that across many people's the philosophy of parenting varies greatly - \\- basically what I'm saying is a very long winded explanation for parents and other differing greatly in what they believe about children's and parents rights. The weaker the perspestive on children's rights the more likely a person will condone abuse and abusive behaviours as they see the balance of consideration towards the parent. Obviously people's individual experiences do matter a lot, however plenty of people that experience abuse actually resolve to condemn abuse and so forth, and I think when it comes to public forums and whatnot you're much more dealing with broad attitudes than individual experience."

      "output": [
        "Through the course of my education in social work I have had to do a bunch of looking into the origins of policing within the United States and I am going to try and answer the questions you ask while also providing a little bit of insight into the modern concept of policing within the US. One of these ideas that you touched base on that can really wrap this question in a nice package is that of police militarization, which when talked about is generally in the context of the modern War on Drugs or War on Terror. Yet this has been an issue from the onset of Colonial North America. The origins of this can be traced back to the first sanctioned \u201cSlave Patrols\u201d in the Carolina colonies in 1704. Which were organized groups of paramilitary vigilantes who would hunt down escaped slaves, punish disobedient slaves and act as a force of terror to deter slave riots (Potter, 2013). As the south would evolve into a solely slave driven economy a militarized society sprung up around it in order to maintain control. The trope where all southern gentlemen were referred to as colonel or captain is more than a fashionable title. As slavery grew larger and took hold of the south the slave patrols of the early years morphed into the state militias, as more manpower was needed to fulfill the duties of the patrols. At this time in history the officers of such militias would be elected, and as the southern states restricted most elected positions to those who are rich, large estate owning white men these officer positions were also filled by the wealthy white elite (Franklin, 1970). These militias were also not restricted to the rich, white men of all standings in southern society would serve either out of a sense of obligation to one's community or as a method of socio-economic mobility (Franklin, 1970). This martial obligation became an integral part of southern male identity, tying together social and gender norms of the region with the idea of violently oppressive behavior (Franklin, 1970). These men would form the various military units that would go on to fight as rebels in the American Civil War, while their descendants would become the insurgency movement of white supremacy in the post-reconstruction south. We can even find lingering evidence of this ideology today where the majority of modern military recruits originated from the south (DeVore, 2020). Though this was not the end of a militarized police force as law enforcement transitioned from a civilian led volunteer militia to an organized and professional uniformed police force. With the rapid industrialization of the post Reconstruction Era United States and the mass migrations of black refugees from the south, to the northern and western urban areas the focus of policing started to shift. As populations around the urban centers started to swell, police were formally organized in order to protect the interests of private industries around these urban centers from perceived lawlessness (DuVernay, 2016). Though in all reality this iteration of law enforcement was no more than enforcers for the rich business owners and corrupt politicians, used to destabilize minority communities and suppress workers and civil rights movements. At times using military weapons and hardware to quell protests, worker strikes or simply perform acts of terror, such as the massacre of the Greenwood neighborhood in Tulsa, OK in 1921 (Lee, 2019). The idea of police acting as a military force goes further around this time with states starting to establish state police forces independent of the municipalities they served; with states like Pennsylvania creating their force modeled after the American occupational forces in the Philippines (Potter, 2013). State police would live in barracks outside of the community to prevent fraternization and thus make it easier to oppress the BIPOC, immigrant and financially unstable communities (Potter, 2013). You can pick up the story of police militarization here transitioning into Nixon\u2019s war on crime, Regan\u2019s war on drugs and Bush\u2019s war on terror; all of which brought federal legitimacy in the form of weapons, training and financial incentives (DuVernay, 2016).

        "That is a lot of questions, all of which have long answers with entire literatures covering them. On the first point, though: Organized, full-time, government-run police forces have existed for thousands of years, typically anywhere large-scale urbanization occurred, e.g., in Ancient Rome [(Furhman, 2012)]. Any claims that a particular organization marks the \"first modern police police force\" is pretty arbitrary, but the London metropolitan police probably have the strongest claim (~1829) for one that looks vaguely like current police forces (largely because current police forces have copied that model)."

        "I would be more interested to see the difference between autistic people in their teens and 20's vs later on as adults in 30s+. Plenty of teens will try to blend in or adopt the looks and speech of a certain group or clique..... basically teens are posers, including myself at that age lol.... but once out on your own, you have to develop your personality on your own and usually, but not always, have multiple social circles or friend groups to have a more unique \"fleshed out\" personality. I wonder if autistic people develop or change their personality and look, or do they kind of stick to the same one as when they were younger?",
        "The cause for masking isn\u2019t a psychological one, it\u2019s a societal one. It is just inherently, fundamentally dangerous to exist as an autistic person in our society. It\u2019s either you mask all your autistic traits and hope to pass as neurotypical, or you spend your life being ostracized, abused, assaulted, discriminated against, or completely ignored like you don\u2019t even exist. We only mask because neurotypicals are fucking horrible heartless people, and if they weren\u2019t, then we wouldn\u2019t mask."

      "output": [
        "We don\u2019t really know enough to know if this is \u201caccurate\u201d but one possible reason for the surface-level disparity is that most cultures allow for a lot more flexibility in gender expression for people assigned female at birth (eg, more tolerance for \u201ctomboys\u201d than \u201csissies\u201d), and also there\u2019s a certain level of gender-related dissatisfaction experienced by some cis women related to living in patriarchal societies. Together this may make it more difficult for trans men to come to self awareness and/or make it easier to stay closeted. In recent decades as awareness of trans issues has increased in some cultures, clinics have demonstrated an increased number of trans men such that overall numbers are more equivalent, which would fit with this explanation. See, eg:",
        "There are two things going on here depending on what generation we're talking about: 1. In the past, trans people born as male strictly outnumbered those born as female for largely economic reasons. Women had a harder time finding employment and often depended on a husband to sustain them economically. You can't transition if you aren't economically independent. This led to transitional care for MTFs advancing at a much faster rate, allowing MTFs to fully pass while FTMs had limited options. For example, the first gender clinic at John Hopkins only accepted natal male patients for over a decade. In older populations, trans women still out number trans men. 2. In 2024, this isn't the case anymore. Male and female individuals transition at similar rates, BUT natal males are more likely to identify as trans women while natal females are more likely to identify as non-binary. So, non-binarys outnumber trans women while trans women outnumber trans men. To my knowledge, there is no formal research why this is, but I can give you a few theories. Trans/progressive spaces sometimes have a negative opinion of men and trans spaces are heavily dominated by (trans)women, which could pressure young trans men entering them as a minority with in a minority to slightly alter their identification. Many people claim \"its easier to be a young women now\" but take that with a gain of salt. It is certainly true that transitioning sex for FTMs is more expensive and the surgeries aren't as perfected as those for MTFs. As a final note, trans representation in media, celebrities, and even bussines is highly dominated by trans women, so it also appears that trans women make up the majority of trans people when non-binary people are actually the largest sub group.",
        "This is interesting - my first question would be about data quality. According to this Statistics Canada article, as of 2022 Canada, Belgium, and New Zealand were some of the only countries to have published representative survey based data as opposed to e.g. non representative surveys. In Canada in 2021 there were 31.5K trans women and 27.9K trans men - definitely a smaller discrepancy.",
        "This might be less cut and dry if you look at the number of afab people who choose to eventually identify as non-binary, not sure if you've taken that into consideration, but might be worth looking into. I don't know how it would affect your statistics, but it might be worth looking up?",
        "What we commonly see is a higher amount of self identified trans women (though this gap is [closing] but a higher amount of nonbinary people who are assigned female at birth. So my assumption is that trans masculine people are just as common as trans feminine, but people who are AFAB are more likely to adopt nonbinary gender identities than people AMAB because of societal limitations on gender flexibility for men versus women.",
        "At least one more recent source suggests this gap has closed. It's relevant to note that your source seems to be outdated - the language they use (\"transwomen\" rather than \"trans women\") is not considered affirming language nowadays, and the recommendations they make for data collection are not necessarily best practice today (although it's certainly an improvement on what they were attempting to correct.)",
        "Those general raw numbers are accurate, from what I can see. I don\u2019t know that the why has been formally studied, though. There\u2019s some indication that natal women are more likely to use \u201calternative identifications\u201d like non-binary or gender neutral than natal men are, which might be a contributor. There\u2019s also some sociocultural factors at play, like society\u2019s general willingness to tolerate very masculine women better than it tolerates very feminine men (which _may_ make a fully transgender identification feel like less of a \u201cneed\u201d for natal women with gender-nonconforming characteristics.) Like a lot of unstudied questions, there is guesswork involved at this point. Note that I\u2019m not a social scientist, I just happened to get this on my feed"

Perhaps we're looking for a similar feeling that sort of \"grounds\" and comforts us when we're hiding under blankets? If not, it could be the warmth. Here is a paper on substituting social warmth with physical warmth: It's on warm showers, but my guess is that it could also extend to temperature regulation under blankets. Hiding under the blanket or in closets also reduce some sensory stimulation, so when our sensory system feels overwhelmed, a dark, quiet, isolated place may help us regulate.",

      "output": [
        "No, it's not a thing. People often don't like to to hear this, but there is zero social science validity to generational psychology. Age (as in stage of life), economic status, race and ethnicity, region, health, gender, and many other factors predict behavior in a way that generation doesn't. Anecdata of Boomers is always already skewed because it's based on an unrepresentative sample of those Boomers who are still alive and exist within the observers' current social circle. [This is a good article that explains] why: \"Poor people die younger in the U.S. That skews American politics.\" It draws on this peer reviewed study: . I've also noticed that people don't see other people as \"Boomers\" unless they already fit a certain profile. For example, houseless people are never called Boomers, even though an increasing number of them are in their seventies. Psychology and biology already explain the mental inflexibility you're talking about. Numerous psychological studies have shown that older people have reduced neuroplasticity and are less likely to admit mistakes. This was true a thousand years ago and will be true long after the last Boomer is dead. However, intergenerational relations, or the perception of intergenerational relations, is pretty bad in the US today. There are many sociological and anthropological theories for why, and the rise of pop-psychological generational narratives like Selfish Boomers vs. Lazy Millenials only encourages this (these generational names were only invented recently, in the 1980s). It's taken for granted in the US dominant WASP culture that generations should segment themselves, that more than two generations should not live together, that adults should never have to be inconvenienced by small children not their own, that sick elderly people should be kicked to the side of the street or stored in nursing homes out of sight, etc. As long as we continue down this path (and we will, because it's in the economic best interests of too many industries currently) the perception and the reality of intergenerational conflict will only keep increasing. I'm not advocating returning to a more traditional-agrarian \"always obey your elders\" kind of mentality, but as a society, we should encourage more empathy with people at all stages of life and realize that people think in different ways at different life stages.",
        "I am in my early 30s and currently dealing with a father who has volatile emotional issues due to mistreatment by his parents as a child. I believe that his unresolved issues from terrible parenting and the subsequent ill-adapted interactions with society that followed have caused him to be incredibly defensive and also arrogant when it comes to his opinions, very easily devolving into aggression when confronted in even minor and polite, but assertive ways. In my eyes, he has developed an insecurity regarding being right due to always being wrong in his parent's eyes and then being rejected by his peers due to miscommunication or even genuine bullying of him has reinforced this idea in his head that he must speak his truth and that he must stick to his guns because in the past more dominant people have put him down when he was both objectively right in his views and when he thought he was right but actually wrong. This negative reinforcement regardless of whether he was right or wrong has trained him to see society and others around him as ready to attack his views for personal reasons and illegitimate ones, regardless of what the other person actually intends with their doubts. He has never properly learned to discern how to converse and debate with someone in a healthy way and now when he is shown he is wrong, he only knows to protect himself from the pain he has felt before and lash out and deny any fallibility- leading to unending escalation until the other person is forced to leave the conversation for their own safety - thus allowing him to feel secure and dominant. After this, he feels in control of the situation and this is why he often will come back in an attempt reconciliation. Somewhere in him he knows he did bad but can't say that so the closest is that both parties failed equally and must move on. Having access to the internet from an early age, along with subsequent access to therapy as I grew older allowed me to understand him better and gain perspective he doesn't have on himself - I had been more braodly socialised and challenged by different perspectives in a safe manner than he had been by the same age. While the situation of a housing crisis where I live also means I have had to adapt to him in order to survive basically, you cannot fight fire with fire and that means my personality has suffered unfortunately while gaining certain coping mechanisms in the sacrifice. These mechanisms have served me in the short term but will destroy anyone over longer periods - thus why therapy is such a benefit. I truly believe in mandatory and free therapy for all citizens, screening for these kinds of issues and addressing them before people can have children and damage them is so important. Harsh parenting is associated with lower self-control and higher aggressive attitudes in children:",

      "output": [
        "Typically you're empowering people with tools to make up their own mind - so say a person is like \"we're all going to die so what's the point?\" a therapist isn't going to try and convince someone they are immortal because its better for them. What they might focus on is whether its worth ruminating on that fact - and are their other ways to consider mortality, does death make other things meaningless. The therapist doesn't tell the client what to think, but help them choose what to think",
        "\"Specifically, if the patient **has a view** that is harming them **but is a fact\"** If it's a view it cannot be a fact. A view is an evaluation of a fact. Facts are objective (universally true), views are subjective (true only for that person). The therapist does not aim to change the fact, but he may aim to change the client's view, if this action helps the client achieve his goal(s). To use an example from another user: \"we're all going to die so what's the point? = view \"we're all going to die\"= fact \"we're all going to die so we might as well fully enjoy the time he have\" - another view",
        "I'm a social worker, so my approach may be a little different. William James is the father of pragmatism, and I really like his take on this. There are things that are verifiably true and untrue. Outside of those things, there is a wide range of things we can't prove, but we have beliefs about. Sometimes, we have a variety of things we could believe, and we aren't completely certain about them. Some of the things in this category are helpful to us and some are detrimental. Pragmatism is to choose the beliefs we can believe that are also helpful to us. For example, say we fail an exam. The failure of the exam is a fact - we can't convince ourselves that we didn't fail. However, we may have a variety of explanations for why we failed. If we believe \"I failed because I'm stupid,\" that may lead us to give up on future attempts, because \"stupid\" is a trait that would pervade all our other attempts. On the other hand, if we believe \"I could have done better if I had spent more time studying this specific material,\" that may lead us to have better study habits and pay more attention to the material required. Therefore, the more helpful, pragmatic belief is the one that isn't a judgment of your character but of the actions you could change. When I've talked to people who feel hopeless, there are very often underlying beliefs like this. Say the person is devastated because their girlfriend broke up with them. There's the grief of that lost relationship, and the only way through that is to just feel it. Grief like this is painful, but generally not hopeless. But sometimes the person is also telling themself that she was the only person who could ever love them, and that causes more suffering than would exist with just the truth of the situation. I ask people that I'm working with to run their self-talk through 2 tests: * Is it true? * Is it helpful? If it's true but it's not helpful, set it aside. We don't need to debate whether or not it's true. But we can find another truth that may be more helpful. The failure or the breakup are true, AND ALSO that isn't the whole story.",
        "The intention is never to convince a patient of something, it isn't our place to give our advice and insert our opinions/biases. Instead, if you're following CBT (the most widely used talk-therapy) here's how it works: 1. Assess their stage of change. Guide them to understand that there is a problem and help them accept change. 2. Psychoeducation. Teach the relationships between situations, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. 3. Help them identify the core belief (e.g., I can't trust anyone) and cognitive distortions (e.g., mind-reading) causing the problem. 4. Guide them through the process of cognitive restructuring and developing coping skills. Possibly the only time we ever try to convince someone of something is in the very beginning: to allow us to help them. A good therapist will never tell their client that their thoughts/feelings are wrong, we just ask questions that make them see things from a new perspective or delve further into why they're thinking/feeling that way. As in your example, if they're very fixated on a fact that makes them feel negatively, I would have them explore why they fixate on it rather than lie and say it's not so bad.",

Then what is the therapist supposed to say?",
        "You would not want to direct a client in to any non-truth. If the client is believing something that is harmful to them then how could what they are believing be true? In essence we make our own truth. If our truth is not serving us then why continue to believe it? The therapist would empower the client to find new truth - truth that serves them well and makes them feel good when we think of it. There is some universality to truth. For example, it serves all people to believe they are worthy of love and to have faith that this is true. If one does not yet have evidence of this truth then you work backwards and you begin to believe it as true in the inner world and then watch this new truth become projected in to the external world.",
        "I guess id read this as the difference between working with emotions and logic. (Practising Therapist but not yet a psychologist) If my patient says \u201cim a sex offender\u201d this may well be fact but im not working with that. Im working with the shame attached to that statement that can, in the right conditions, spiral someone towards further offending. In this example, youd be exploring the therapist\u2019s values around therapy really. Do they believe in change and do they believe in basic human worth? There\u2019s no lying involved. Offend against someone, theres no back tracking. But addressing the shame, self esteem can go a long way to helping that person live a fulfilling and safer existence moving forward",
        "It is not possible for a belief to be both true and harmful to the client. Beliefs are harmful when they are not true. If something is harmful then it's either part of reality (the belief about it isn't what's harmful), or it's a belief which deviates from reality and prevents the client from acting optimally."

        "Therapist here. There's a lot of reasons a mental health professional (or someone claiming to be) shouldn't offer advice to strangers online. First is that you have no way of knowing if someone online knows what they're talking about. Anyone can say they're a professional on the internet. They could be giving harmful advice or misinformation. Second is that even if someone is a professional or knows what they are talking about, even if they are a therapist, they are not YOUR therapist. In the therapy room, your therapist gets to know you, collects your history, and if they need more context about you to help you better they can ask. A person responding to a reddit post only has one small slice of whatever problem you share, and advice that might work in one situation might not be helpful in another. Third is that in therapy, the relationship itself is a huge part of the healing process. Through a proper professional relationship you gain a lot of things, you learn how to process and express emotions to someone, you get the supportive and nonjudgmental presence of someone, and the therapist can point out your behaviors and thoughts in real time - all of which you don't get from a reddit post. Fourth is that even in therapy, advice isn't even really the point. A therapist that only gives advice runs the risk of giving a lot of bad advice, or at least advice that isn't helpful to the person. Any piece of advice is like a white elephant gift; it's a great fit for some, but useless to others. Often therapy work is more about holding a compassionate space for the client and guiding a client to find their own solutions, because the choices you make yourself are more likely to stick than advice someone gives you. Fifth is that the wrong mental health advice can be actively harmful. Telling someone to \"face their fears\" might be helpful for someone with mild anxiety but might be harmful for someone with PTSD. Telling someone to \"eat healthier\" might be helpful for some with depression but harmful to someone with an eating disorder. &#x200B; The time and work of a mental health professional is expensive for a reason. It is work, it takes a lot of education and training and skill to do it right. With free advice, well, you get what you pay for. I do wish therapy was more accessible for more people (you can look for therapists that offer a sliding scale, or use a site like Open Path Collective, btw), but because it is not, all the psych and therapy subreddits have a ton of people asking for essentially free therapy; but not only is that unfair to ask that of professionals, it simply isn't possible to do it right, and there's a huge risk of harming someone if you try."

      "output": [
        "This is a difficult question to answer, and certainly from an empirical standpoint. I will do my best to provide an approximation based on what we know broadly about these two. Hormones are incredibly powerful compounds that have wide-ranging and cascading interactive effects on the body. Because they often have direct effects on the neurotransmitters of the brain, which underly basic perceptual and neurocognitive functioning, it\u2019s safe to say that hormones have a *much greater* proximal effect on our lived experience than thoughts. Thoughts are the internal manifestation of language, which functions as a sort of \u201coperating system\u201d of the brain. On a very basic level, language allows the brain to create abstract associations between two or more concepts. But a seemingly emergent process of language is that it also allows us to conceptualize the past and the future. Our thoughts often take the form of interpretations of our emotions and behaviors. Our stream of consciousness is similar to a narrative of our lived experience, and how we construct thoughts in any given moment has a cumulative impact on our convictions and beliefs over time. All of that said, it\u2019s very unlikely that we can significantly change our immediate hormone levels through our thoughts. Conversely, it\u2019s very plausible that a severe shift in hormone levels could alter our consciousness, even leading to things like psychosis and delusional thinking, which would absolutely distort our thoughts. This would be a relatively rare occurrence, but it\u2019s indicative of how the strength of hormonal effects on thoughts is generally going to be larger than the strength of cognitive effects on hormones. Our hormone levels are also largely genetically conferred and dependent on fundamental environmental signals like circadian rhythm and developmental cues such as age. There might be some ways that our thoughts could indirectly influence our hormone levels, but the effects are likely quite small compared to the effects of hormonal changes on cognitive status. These are somewhat broad generalizations, but hopefully this gives you a basic understanding of the relative balance between these two things."

It\u2019s actually quite a lot more complicated than most would think when you really boil it down. What exactly makes someone a woman? Chromosomes? Genitals? Gender? Appearance? Each of these things can be mixed and matched and answers often differ. The right wing pretends it answers these questions but really doesn\u2019t. The right wing fails to be empathetic enough to the problems of disenfranchised groups and doesn\u2019t do enough to equalise the playing field. Right wing version: The left has taken hold of most of the larger institutions. It claims tolerance but hands out punishment and censorship. It condemns men while failing to acknowledge the contributions and sacrifices men have made. It simplifies the past to the idea that men were tyrants over women and were akin to slaves. Marriage is declining, birth rates are declining and general unhappiness is on the rise. The idea of fighting and struggling for a better life has been replaced by the struggle to be the biggest victim and get the most handouts.",

It's not linear, and completely subjective per person. Which tragically leaves a lot of people in a state of uncertain limbo in terms of 'where they're at', \"Am I making it in life okay?\", \"Where am I positioned in this life race? is it better or worse than my peers\", The only gauge in society of how well one is doing these days, is by relating yourself to others around you. It's kept in small boxes, because I think our brain can rationalize the bigger picture easier (ie. you'll be doing 'better' than some, 'worse off' than others), but when it's smaller, and you know people more personally, it makes it easier to compare side-by-side, I believe the reason past selves are never compared to present selves is because we all see ourselves in a constant state of betterment (at least, ideally so). The current you is the best face of yourself (for the time being), so making past comparisons would be a lot of backtracking, In a perfect world, the comparison should not exist and people should just be allowed, to well, 'be'.

In modern cognitive psychology research (which is the real bulk of modern experimental psychology) you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who is interested or even thinks it is possible to scientifically understand the nature of experience. Instead they\u2019re happy making models of attention and recognition processes. You\u2019ll find phenomenologists in philosophy and humanities departments where producing empirical work isn\u2019t necessarily mandated, and because it can be a tool to understand concepts like place, culture, literature, song and so forth. Their goal then is not really to understand the mind (well except in the case of cognitive science/philosophy of mind types) but to use phenomenology as a method.",
        "I saw your post in askphilosophy but couldn't answer you there There is an overlap and similiraties between phenomenology and some aspects of psychology :For instance, Julian Ajuriaguerra a neuropsychiatrist knows for work related to psychomotricity was heavily influenced by it. Merleau Ponty a phenomology philosoph had ties with psycholoanalysis and was interested psychology. Gestalt theory and therapy and probably other approaches have roots in phenomenology. Both phenomenology and psychology may find historical origins / roots in kantian philosophy and constructivism in general. A fair amount of neuro and cognitive models are constructivists, this is especially true in developmental psychology. Clinical psychologists may have a phenomenological / existentialist stance when listening a patient : they bring clinical material that is subjective. You can have \"Proust's madeleine\", a subjective research for authenticity ... It also may depend on the country where certain movements are more or less present. I don't know in the US, but psychodynamic approach are still very strong in some parts of europe and may have phenomenological components. But psychology is a very broad therm. It is a science in the positivist sense, it follows the scientific method. There are several branches in psychology as well that are more or less tied to other disciplines : neuropsychology, psychophysics, social psych, behavioural and cognitive, psychodynamic .... There are a lot of quantitative studies in psychology. Even qualitative studies have to follow scientific method and be tied to scientific models."

For most any set of traits or experiences I could name that seem to link a majority of perpetrators together, I could find a greater number of people who have all of those same traits but who do not perpetrate. Most people who sexually abuse children were themselves sexually abused as children, but most people who were sexually abused as children do not grow up to become sexual abusers. So at this point we're still kind of grasping at straws to figure out what traits and experiences actually distinguish abusers from non-abusers. In partial answer to your question, it might be helpful to realize that molestation, like many other crimes, is rarely the product of a rational choice-- the person is not rationally considering the right or wrong of their actions, or even the probability they will be caught or the punishment they might face. Most often it is the product of dysregulated emotion and desperate need states, and those are certainly areas in which survivors of childhood trauma are likely to struggle. I'm a little rusty on the literature, since I haven't read extensively on this subject in almost a decade, but I believe that most perpetrators of child sexual abuse are well aware that what they are doing is harmful and wrong, but are so powerfully compelled by their emotional needs and so lacking in emotional resources that they feel they cannot help themselves."

One of the more common diagnoses serial killers would have is Antisocial Personality Disorder which is characterized by a lack of empathy. However, there have been brains scans done on individual serial killers and also groups of convicted murderers. There are differences not only between murderers and people not in the justice system, but between murderers and other kinds of criminals (like burglars). Murderers are often found to have less gray matter. Gray matter helps with social and behavioral control. There\u2019s often reduced size and activity in the prefrontal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex is the \u201cgrown up\u201d part of your brain that lets you delay gratification and control your behavior and experience empathy. For some murderers there may be psychosis, brain damage or even a brain tumor which is considered a different issue and controlled for in the studies above. But there have been cases of people who felt distress over their drive to murder and were found to have brain tumor or damage on the parts of their brain that controlled their behavior. So those are the neurological reasons, and the reasons FOR those differences are many including genetics, exposure to substances in the womb, illness, malnutrition, damaging substance use later in life, and of course early-life emotional trauma, which ultimately causes physical changes to the brain.

And is hypothesised to be associated with wanting to propagate one's own genetics by assuring the wellbeing of genetically similar individuals. I can't remember where I got this scenario from but I've found it helpful to explain this. Lets say you have an island that is divided into two parts, with tribe A owning half of the island, and tribe B owning the other half. There are 50 members in one tribe, and 50 in the other (in reality that would lead to inbreeding problems presumably but lets ignore that). Now lets also say that there is a crisis on this island, due to a food shortage. If the tribes do nothing, they'll both die of starvation. Fortunately, there is a food source available, which has the ability to save 50 people in total from starvation. In a perfectly egalitation scenario, we might randomise which person of each tribe has access to the food. If it turns out being perfectly equal, 25 members of tribe A will survive, and 25 members of tribe B will survive. But there's a problem there. Human beings are biological creatures, and seem to have an innate drive for their genes to spread. As a result of this, they have an innate preference for their own wellbeing, as well as the wellbeing of other family members, cousins, and, to an extent, members of their own ethnic group, which they may prioritize over others. Because of this, it may be the case (sorry this is where I get speculatory, will delete if asked) that humans will not act in perfectly egalitarian ways, and want to hoard the resource for their own tribe. They may justify it by having prejudice against the opposing tribe, and see them as lesser. As a result, they are able to simultaneously promote their own genetics, while not feeling as if they are doing anything immoral. The end result is that it allows for the continuation of one's own genes.",
        "The comments on this thread are a great example of how people are socialized into racist ways of thinking.

The [Wikipedia essay] is a decent overview of the history and the role of social sciences in producing the idea of race. u/alchemistofator is repeating the naive racist argument first developed to justify European and American colonization and exploitation, and to support eugenics and argue against interracial relationships. To the extent this argument makes sense to a reader, it is only because they have already developed racist ways of thinking. Notice how this response depends on the collapse of the distinction between race, ethnicity and kin group. These three terms are distinct in the social sciences, and a trained social scientist would never treat them as equivalent categories. The commenter is hoping that if they sound \u201clike an academic\u201d you will not look too closely at their flawed and illogical argument. The fact that we don\u2019t teach children how to distinguish between race, ethnicity and kin terms is one origin point of racism \u2014 as a society we allow children to learn and continue thinking that skin color or other physical features predict both cultural similarity and genetic relatedness. So the fact that your parents had to go out of their way to try to teach you not to be racist shows that the default position in the US is to learn to be racist.

There's a huge section at the start of the manual that describes exactly what the process looks like and how they tried to make it better than previous editions. It's LONG. My nutshell version: - researchers keep researching and debating the existence and nature of different disorders, and publishing their findings all the time - when a new DSM is being created, there's a great deal of debate with different researchers putting their opinions out there. If you do a literature search you can find many examples of published papers doing this - committees are formed by groups of experts in different areas, and other people are invited to make submissions for them to consider - they convene and make their recommendations - draft criteria get tested for clinical reliability and validity and to generate feedback from other interest groups - they revise, and re-revise - after publishing, they keep revising and researchers keep submitting papers and then they publish revised editions .... And so it goes on",
        "The DSM is not the Bible and should be used but also not relied entirely upon, diagnosing mental illness is a complicated procedure, a lot of personal perspective is required to make the diagnosis, because it isn\u2019t something that can be tested and then applied like drawing blood to find out A1C levels are for determining if a person may have diabetes errors happen, misdiagnosis can be a serious problem and can influence how a person views themselves and how others view them, this is especially true for children, involuntary commitment is also a serious problem, coercion in admitting people to mental health facilities has been shown that it causes mistrust and people learn that they shouldn\u2019t report symptoms out of fear of being involuntarily committed again, it can be a traumatic experience",

Psychiatric hospitalization is less than a week on average, and generally only for acute crisis stabilization. If we want to talk about how MDD should have four nuanced categories vs one.

I don't believe there are strict rules or criteria for how the committees decide other than diagnosis and diagnostic criteria being supported by literature (which is a very broad statement) and I have no idea by what metric they reject criteria.",
        "Other answers are a much better summary than I could get at, but just for further resources, the book \"A Research Agenda For DSM-V\" (it was published first so they used the numeral V and not the number 5) is a deep-dive into what the research side of the process was *intended* to look like prior to execution. Here's a PDF of all 300 some pages: The introduction, particularly the \"background\" section, is probably the best summary.",
        "It's up to APA. It comes down to clinical significance to the patient, empirical evidence such as strong and consistent research, and consensus among experts on the diagnostic criteria. When we dig a little deeper, we see numerous non-clinical elements and sociopolitical factors at play, like some have pointed out. Disorders are social constructs, and what is considered \u201cdisordered behavior\u201d is determined by societal norms and widely varies between cultures and values.",
        "The DSM undergoes a rigorous and systematic review process with each new edition. The task force and work groups are made of of clinicians and researchers who review existing research, get input from the psychiatric community, and sometimes engage in trials to test proposed changes in real-world settings. The revision process for each edition of the DSM can involve hundreds of people from various fields of mental health from around the world. The revision process is very long \u2014work on the DSM-5 began in 1999, though it wasn't published until 2013. Drafts of new editions are often made available for public comment, allowing for feedback. Each new edition sparks debate which reflects the evolving understanding of mental health and the complexities of categorizing mental disorders. The APA has shifted towards a \"living document\" model which allows for more frequent updates and revisions, which is a significant change from the past static versions released every decade or so. Recently the DSM has had critics who argue for more client/patient-centered and phenomenological approaches that encompass the lived experience of those with mental health conditions."

Because humans are not the most emotionally regulated, even though we pretend to be. This regulation is not taught in school typically. Humans, brain-wise, still operate from a primitive mindset when it comes to cruelty, anger, and entitlement. Some cruel people are looking to feel powerful, important, and not life a failure or insecure. Others are cruel because they succumb to \"group think\" or lies from media or well-known figures. A lot of the time, people are cruel because they want to be, and they can be. They choose cruelty because they can. Because, cruelty can be the point, like in terms of sadism. People can derive pleasure and enjoyment and happiness from being cruel. It can also be the means and method. Just because they can. Because no human is perfect, and we all have the ability to be cruel and manipulative.",
        "Factors at play I think would be psychopathy or sociopathy, aggression developed from trauma (such as abuse received as a child or aquired brain trauma from injury), power and authority (people who are more aggressive may seek positions of power where they can enact cruelty on others), and also situations where people are encouraged to be violent or cruel to others (military and warfare). The debate on whether humans are inherently evil is more philosophical than psychological. All humans have the physical ability to be aggressive or violent, but may not have the mental capacity to do these things or have environments that support them in being well-adjusted or healthy. Some animals can be \"cruel\" in a similar way. Some animals exhibit aggression against members of the same species and social group over matters related to territory, mating, and survival. I think it's fair to draw evolutionary comparisons to humans in this way. Judging that as \"good or evil\" goes back to being more philosophical.",

I think the real question is how does one who does wrong to another reconcile the mental dissonance that ensues? Perhaps that\u2019s how antisocial personality disorders develop, it\u2019s a coping strategy for those who choose to engage in these bad deeds.",
        "Humans are intelligent, the more intelligent a life form is, the higher its propensity for cruelty. Intellect is basically an index of emotional and behavioral possibilities, a mouse has a small index, eats, poops, breeds, runs when scared, dies. Mice don't need therapy, they're not complex creatures, mice don't sodomize and then decapitate each other out of obsession or boredom. They don't have the intellectual tools to understand those emotional and behavioral concepts, let alone determine how it makes them feel and whether they want more or less... but dolphins do, chimpanzees do, humans do. If you're an intelligent being living inside a meatball on earth, its kinda factory installed, we all have it in us, even you. You just haven't had the right mixture of experiences to be able to search that part of the index, but its there, we have limitless potential, that includes the potential to be on either side of the polarity."

Often, trichotillomania is associated/seen alongside neurological diagnoses like OCD. It is a BFRB (body focused repetitive behavior) that is akin to nail-biting. In my own work, I do feel more alarmed thinking of a client showing me self-inflicted bald patches than I do them showing me they click their light switch six times. This is probably because trich involves a lasting physical change and involves something painful; although both are maladaptive, one is more likely to impact their quality of life/self-concept, etc. That said, I should also say trichotillomania is not a self-harm behavior. And you're right that it can be exacerbated or more prevalent alongside other diagnoses, particularly neurological ones."

So far it doesn\u2019t come close to the efficacy of the current gold standard approaches for symptom remission and long term improvement in functioning.

        "It's tough to give a specific answer without knowing more about you and what you mean by \"hurting the ones you love,\" but speaking generally this is very common phenomenon. For one thing, when people feel confident of a relationship, they tend to be less inhibited. Folks who spend the whole day holding in their selfish impulses or witty barbs feel like they can finally relax and let it all out when they get home. It's possible there's a kind of subconscious decision like \"I know these people will love me no matter what, so I don't have to worry as much about being a jerk to them,\" but that may be a little overly simplistic. For whatever reason, we just tend to be less conscientious about our behavior in the situations where we're more confident. Another major point is that it can be more upsetting when someone who's close to you does something that bothers you than it is when a stranger or loose acquaintance does it. I had a friend once describe it as \"it's like a part of your body isn't working right.\" There are rational reasons for this, like that you spend a lot of time with this person and so it feels more important to make their behavior change than it would be to change the behavior of someone you'll never see again, but there are probably irrational reasons for it too. Neither of these points justifies or excuses being an asshole to the people you love, of course. It's important that you figure out how not to do that, both for your sake and for theirs. But hopefully this context helps to answer your question and may give you some ideas about how to approach your own behavior change.

        "My understanding is that IQ sees its most beneficial uses in special education. Why? Because it is a standardized assessment that allows you to pick out students who are outliers in a number of skills that, while not a comprehensive ideal of intelligence, are closely correlated with the skills needed to succeed in school, both academically and interpersonally. Identifying outliers is really important in this process: special education doesn\u2019t care that you have below average IQ because it thinks you\u2019re dumb (ideally, at least), but because it needs to pick out individuals who require specific supports and skills. But IQ, while a valuable tool in this very holistic field, is not *real*. Performance on IQ doesn\u2019t equal intelligence or cognitive ability, it is, on a mass scale, a fairly reliable indicator of these things. I would also go so far as to push back against those who think IQ should be done away with entirely. IQ being used by freaks pushing racist \u2018race science\u2019 is bad, but that\u2019s not because IQ is bad\u2014it\u2019s because race science is bad. IQ is a tool. It is only a tool. Like jackhammers and dynamite, removed from the appropriate context it becomes dangerous, and those who misuse it are irresponsible: but it has legitimate uses so long as we accept that they are not universal, and it is not the only answer to any given question.",
        "I wouldn't say people consider IQ to be a pseudo-scientific concept. I believe the issue arose from the false expectations and how different it is from reality. It has been popularized that a person with a higher IQ is going to be a top notch genius capable of everything and anything. Then when a person actually meets someone who is above average, they realize that is not the case. Generally speaking, people don't really understand what intelligence is, and what IQ represents. &#x200B; The way I explain it to the people, and the way they seem to understand is following: Imagine the intelligence being the ability to learn, and being able to use your knowledge and skills efficiently. IQ represents a score of that intelligence. As expected, with the higher score, your ability to learn and apply what you learn goes higher. Basically, the best way to look at it is to see it as a potential, a latent power some may even say. Does IQ matter? Yes, yes it does, and it can make a difference. Is it some sort of cheat engine that gives you a head start in life? Absolutely no. &#x200B; Having high IQ does not mean you will have more success in life than an average person. You might even end up way below an average person. Just because someone has a potential, does not mean they will reach it. There is a ton of factors that have an impact on that. Family, friends, social status, rich/poor, the way a child was raised, mental health issues, physical health issues and it goes on and on..",
        "The \"tested\" IQ is measuring specific verbal and performance areas (and others depending on which measure) that are thought to be correlated with IQ by various academics over many decades. The reputable ones (not free on line quizzes) are reliable and valid for the constructs they measure. Meaning you will get the same score over time within a coefficient of variability. Yada Yada. I'm tired so may not be saying things perfectly. Don't hate pls. Correlation does not imply causation, as someone mentioned. An IQ test doesn't always correlate with an achievement test, and that is one way we diagnose learning issues. There is also a label \"gifted but lazy\" or underachieving. You may have book smarts, but don't have motivation. No one relies on one score to make conclusions. We gather a crap ton of collateral data when performing academic assessments.

You really need to get into critical theory to think about bullying in a way that is most useful. Bullying is about political economy, ie controlling access to resources, either concrete goods or attention. It\u2019s also an effective way to enforce hierarchy. Both of these are methods of consolidating and distributing power. Most bullies understand this on an intuitive level, and though many of them bully and demean in order to fix their own insecurities there is a significant percentage of the population that does it because they want a hierarchy and it feels good to be above someone in said hierarchy. Hell, for many of them it feels good to be BELOW someone in the hierarchy. This is the core conceit of the psychologist Bob Altemeyer, one of my favorites, and while his research isn\u2019t very popular today (because it doesn\u2019t really fit with the ideological frame of the people who tend to fund psychological studies) the two scales he developed are still well maintained and valid.

Bully's tend to \"punch down\" which you'd think would be more obvious, but the irony is because people don't want to be targets of a bully either they err towards silence or engaging in bullying too,",
        "It's not clear that the immediate cause of bullying is a biological one - there are more relevant social psychological influences at play. Status and respect are strong incentives for behaviour; we fear loss of status and shame so we engage in strategies to guard ourselves against it. Bullying is often about individuals with high status in a group trying to maintain that status by directing negative social impulses away from them. If people don't feel there is enough status or respect to go around in a group setting (often hierarchical settings such as corporations, the army, etc) a culture of bullying is more likely to take root. Twitter is just such a place - a zero-sum situation where you can gain likes by targeting others using shame. [Opinion] Under Musk it's even more like a classroom without any adult supervision.",

Politicians, law enforcement, clergy, businessmen, kardashians entertainers and sometimes therapists are able to lead good lives with assumedly healthy relationships within the law insofar as they have an absence of malignant behaviors or an abundance of privilege and power. My observation in listening to narcissistic clients and their victims is that narcissism is one possible adaptation to mistreatment by other narcissists, and that a society structured to be free of bullies and social predators would cease to produce them. The last US president for instance has popularized narcissistic behavior and ideology, so if we can make it worse we can likely make it better.",

He looks to \u2018philosopher kings\u2019 that may be able to see the true way for things of being (but may be unsuccessful in passing that down to others). Therefore, if Plato proposes absolute truths, they are in opposition of the agreed norms of the grander society. The prisoners in the cave agreed that the shapes they saw are real, but one was able to see that they are shadows projected on the wall. That individual got out and was able to see the sun/real form/truth. When they came back, they were virtually blinded by it, and may not be able to convince the others of this truth. Hence why Socrates/Plato were not entirely in favor of democracy. For them, the norms of the layman is restrictive, and there may be only some that can take themselves outside of the illusion. However, they probably wont be able to show this truth to others and that\u2019s probably why Plato divided society as he does. All is that to say is that what you call Plato\u2019s \u2018norm\u2019 of eternal truths is different from the commonly accepted norms in society/the masses. For Plato, that societal norm is an illusion, and he is trying to get people to see past that to arrive to the real forms (which maybe you can phrase it as the TRUE or ULTIMATE norm). He is asking you to look past an illusion for the real. Therefore, he is not asking people to question theirs norms and accept another set of norms, but he is asking you to question what you believe and then find the real truth (not a new agreed upon, democratic norm; but rather, an absolute one). Although, he may have been pessimistic about who can do that. In the platonic sense, it\u2019s all an arrival to THE truth (and in this post we can say norm for the sake of understanding); so a platonic take wouldn\u2019t see an issue with asking you to question your currently held norms as you are moving closer to the \u2018right\u2019 one. Obviously since then, many have put this absolute truth in question, and I think you are already reading some of their new formulations and critiques. Although, hermeneutical approaches to the allegory of the cave come from others, not Plato; for anyone that agrees with Plato, there is no issue here. For others, we may see some problems with absolutist thinking, and maybe have seen terms like truth shift meanings over time\u2026.",
        "Plato's cave allegory reflects his exploration of epistemology and the nature of reality. While he introduces the concept of ideal forms and an absolute truth, the allegory also challenges normative thinking by illustrating the limitations of perception and the influence of societal constructs. Plato encourages questioning and seeking deeper understanding beyond conventional beliefs, acknowledging the complexity of truth and the need for intellectual exploration. The allegory doesn't necessarily present a contradiction but rather an invitation to critically examine and transcend conventional understanding."

However, a different study looking at local authorities found that found prices dropped as immigration increased due to locals choosing to leave, which was backed up by similar studies in Spain, Canada and the US. One of the reasons this is hard to distangle is because a lot of areas that are attractive to immigrants are also attractive to internal migration (e.g. London, NYC, LA, Vancouver etc etc).

        "Well, the answer to your question essentially boils down to the [Church-Turing thesis.] Yes, computer scientists have collectively chosen to *define* \"uncomputable\" to be the same as \"uncomputable by a Turing machine\". This is because every remotely \"plausible\" computational scheme that has been considered is, at most, as powerful as a Turing machine. For instance, with some relatively weak assumptions, you can show that any system whose behavior can be described by the laws of quantum mechanics can also be simulated to arbitrary precision by a Turing machine. (See, e.g. [this paper] In theory, these assumptions might be able to be violated by things like closed timelike curves, but it's not known whether the real-world laws of physics allow for such loopholes. So even though the Church-Turing thesis is not a rigorously-proven mathematical theorem, it serves as a reasonably strong *philosophical* justification for using Turing machines as the benchmark for what is and isn't computable.",
        "Such numbers can\u2019t be computed by Turing machine, or by any algorithm in any Turing equivalent model of computation. As /u/teraflop\u2019s comment suggests, the Church-Turing thesis makes the claim that this is **all** models of computation. The Church-Turing thesis isn\u2019t completely proven, but all known computational models that are actually implementable are Turing equivalent. Because of Turing equivalence of different models of computation this means we can use any particular model. It is also common to simply not specify a model since, while the exact details will differ between models, you can map algorithms from one model to another.",
        "Non-computable numbers are not non-computable because of their value. They're non-computable because of the question that is answered by their value. So for instance, all integers are computable because there is a straightforward way to count to every integer. But if you ask what is the smallest integer that will never been written down in human history, then I'm afraid there is no way to work out the answer such a question. There clearly *is* such a number because the heat-death of the universe is coming, but we have *absolutely* no way to compute it exactly."

        "Your php script that handles the HTML form... Are the actions it takes fairly simple, without reliance on other services running on your EC2 VM? Could you go ahead and host the HTML form itself as a series of static resources on S3, then replace the php stack on your EC2 VM with a single AWS Serverless Lambda Function (also in php if you like, or any supported language) which processes the form. Make an Event Source Mapping for the Lambda, coming from an AWS Serverless API Gateway instance. The latter will provide a static web URL that can be used to call your Lambda via HTTP. You can set this whole thing up using the AWS web console, or by installing the aws-sam cli tool on your dev machine. You might then be able to get rid of your EC2 instance completely, and do the whole thing \"serverless\" as above. No more OS patching, no more webserver/PHP updates, and no more SSH interface being exposed because there's not even a VM to SSH into anymore. Your form-handling function runs directly inside AWS Lambda cloud, and is exposed to the web via the Event Source Mapping. You only pay for the compute time consumed handling each actual form submission, and don't pay to have a VM that's running 24/7 but sitting idle a lot of the time.",
        "Why is SSH insecure? This is the primary way to connect into servers. To increase security you'd want to do something like change the SSH port from 22 to something else, have robust security groups set up, have something like fail2ban installed. You should also disable the root user and set up a valid sudo account with a strong password or certificate-login instead of a password.

With the video downloaded to your machine use ffmpeg to extract just the audio. Again this can be a standalone step using the ffmpeg executable from the terminal, or you could use the library in Python. 3. Use a speech recognition library to convert the audio stream to text. Again, plenty of (good) online libraries in Python and some (mediocre, in my experience..) offline ones.

Also, you can take care of hosting for him and charge a small monthly fee, which can add up to a decent number as you get more and more customers.",
        "WordPress is great too, you can host it cheaper than alot of these drag and drop platforms or have the customer host and stage it for development. There are drag and drop builders for WordPress that make it a lot easier to set up pages and not waste too much time on the technicalities for basic static page design. Elementor is my favorite builder for it, and if you know some php you can add more complex functionality. And yoast SEO is great for adding basic on page without too much hassle. There's plenty out there to make it easier for you. Dupal is pretty much the same stack but some people like it better for some reason, someone mentioned square space already, some people really like webflow (it's more dev friendly than wix or square space or any of those that you hear about), etc. If you don't want pay hosting or make anyone pay hosting GitHub pages and Jekyll is great and you can cname the domain. The only downside to that is the client doesn't get to go in and make changes, they have to ask you. And if you want to get an email service for them then you're going to have to pay anyway so may as well get some solid apache hosting since the page is not the only thing they're gonna want as a business. Alot of the time for us devs it's easy to think like a dev but we often fail to think like a businessm It helps to have design skills too, I've made pretty nice looking landing pages out of basically nothing provided from clients. You can look at other barber sites and see what they do and basically make your own copied flavor of that. And chances are, the client will like it and tell you change this change that, add this image add that image. They always all of a sudden know what they want once they see you've put something on a page. AI is also great for filling text areas, you can make it a little better, get their input and bam. You're also way undercharging bud. Even for a one pager I would charge 500-750 but that's probably because I'm making content for them. On the other hand I'm using a page builder and I do it way faster. If you're doing the front end from scratch or using a framework that's going to be way more than 50 bucks of work"

        "Your girlfriend's mentality has at worst been engineered and at best been co-opted by employers of both blue collar and white collar workers to divide and conquer. You can discuss ad infinitum whose work is \"harder\" because comparing physical labor and abstract reasoning requires subjective judgments to quantify something that has no singular objective metric. I suspect the root issue here is that your girlfriend is discontent with her job, comes home in a shit mood, and is minimizing the work you do because it makes her negative emotions feel validated. In such a situation I think I would explain that regardless of whether or not she is right, the conversation is not constructive. Her discontent is the problem and her comments are the symptom, so ask if there's anything you can do (within the range of your own boundaries) to address the problem. What can you do IN THAT MOMENT to help her decompress from a hard day at work? At the same time, advocate for yourself and call her out when she minimizes your emotions or experience. Even if your job were easy (it isn't) you would still have shitty, stressful days because variability exists. Healthy relationships cannot exist without some grace and understanding about this. This does become problematic when it comes to things like chores around the house because you're likely trying to reach some equitable balance and that does require trying to quantify things. Instead of trying to balance things perfectly, negotiate what each of you are willing to do, with some understanding that this needs to be pliable and not prescriptive. If you do dishes 85% of the time and 15% of the time you ask her to on a case-by-case \"I'm feeling shitty, can you do something nice for me?\" basis, anyone that wants to achieve a solution should understand this. There are days when neither my girlfriend nor I have done any work at all but one of us just happens to be in a shit mood and we're able to cover for each other in these situations, knowing that these imbalances are exceptions rather than the rule.",

We typically had somewhere between 5-20 minutes to complete a delivery. There were always too many, and you couldn\u2019t go home until it was *all* delivered, because it\u2019s medical equipment. I worked so hard I\u2019d sweat through my shirt any time of year, and during the summer it would quite literally be disgustingly soaking wet. Fucking loved it. I\u2019d had so many pieces of heavy, sharp metal fall into my shins at that job that I quit feeling it. I routinely came home worse for wear, having been minorly injured while getting yelled at by clients who were typically dumber than a fencepost but confidently ignorant. Many frequently lied in an attempt to get me reprimanded or terminated so that they could keep their shitty $15 pieces of rental medical equipment. I still daydream about the simplicity of that job versus software development. I still sometimes wish I had never left, because software development is fucking exhausting. The learning never stops, your coworkers couldn\u2019t code their way out of a fucking conversation (and somehow I always end up fixing their garbage), management pushes for features that were never planned for in extremely complicated systems, there\u2019s never time to refactor and *it would likely require a full rewrite to get anything approaching maintainable*, my body aches to be outside, I rarely leave my house, I\u2019m braindead by the time I\u2019m finished, and I constantly have to context-switch around sub-projects and learn *whole new systems with ZERO documentation, because my coworkers decided that the only thing better than writing shitty code is writing shitty code without instructions*. Also: JavaScript. Fuck it. Fuck it forever. Like yeah, sorry that she\u2019s filled with grass-is-greener syndrome, but I\u2019ve been on both sides of the fence and software development is definitely harder in my opinion. I\u2019ve worked landscaping, I\u2019ve worked factories, I\u2019ve done sales, probably everything inbetween, but software development takes the cake. We can all play the \u201cI\u2019ve got it worse game\u201d, and if she wants to go that route: that fantastic medical oxygen/equipment gig I\u2019d had was 60-90 hours a week, up until 10-2am, and I\u2019d be on-call for weeks at a time (dealing with EVERY customer call that came in, good times). The main point is that she needs to respect your work. You could shit on her for not working a mentally stimulating job; I\u2019d hope that you don\u2019t, because that would be the same as what she\u2019s doing and it wouldn\u2019t be okay. You two need to come to a mutual understanding of respect. From the way you\u2019ve discussed this matter in your prompt, it sounds like you *do* respect her work. She should afford you the same courtesy. The sad truth is that physical jobs are fucking brutal, but they pay far less than jobs requiring extensive knowledge and skills (software).

At one point it got so bad, they found me wandering around delirious at the wrong end of the bus line after a shift. I've also done 6 hour (or more) stints of coding - holding more abstract models of 10,000+ line codebases in my head the whole time, without losing concentration just in case everything vanished from the most minor distraction. I used to relish the exhaustion in my younger years, but these days I'm simply not capable of this anymore. &#x200B; One of these destroyed my body, leaving me with fuck all energy or will to do anything - not even move some days.

That evokes the kind of exhaustion I feel after a hard day of coding. It's not physically demanding, but you're zombified and it makes it harder to do any task that requires planning or problem solving. Objectively, she's probably right, she probably works harder. Our jobs tend to be more stressful though, which is exhausting in it's own right. As for household chores, I like divvying them up so one person \"owns\" each.

If I go for a walk and have some reason to mention it to her I won't.

When you're forced to think hard and problem solve all day, actually expends a large amount of real energy, it can be very difficult to maintain a high level of attention all day, can be very difficult to stay on task all day and be working at your intellectual or cognitive capacity for prolonged periods of time while you sort through series of problems. I can also be challenging when you have to switch tasks frequently, organize a lot of concurrent information, keep a lot of stuff in your head, and balance a lot of different aspects of your job. Getting up moving around and clearing your head totally makes sense, because it probably does help you maintain focus, because eventually your brain literally gets tired. Needs to disengage a little bit in order to maintain the high level of metabolic demand you're placing on it.

It seems as if you're at least familiar with APIs. I've never played with Zillow's API, but all the ones I've messed with use a url to make an API query and that query returns a JSON file. A JSON file either has to be programmatically parsed to extract the exact information you want or needs to be run through an online JSON parser to get data back as a table that is human readable. This human readable information could easily be copied and pasted into an excel spreadsheet set up with filters and some limited query ability. Up until this point, all of this operation (getting the data and deciphering the data into usable information) is pretty low tech and can be done just by brute force (someone entering the API url and copying and pasting the data to a parsing tool). Are you already doing this much of the operation by hand? You could even use a tool like Power Automate to do all of these operations for you each day (or however often you want them done). If you want to use this spreadsheet to track communications with agents, it would be easy enough to add additional columns for those things. But now you mention the word \"dashboard\"... Here's where the complexity and variability of the project costs come into play. A dashboard can be as simple as static data that has no or limited functionality. That spreadsheet referenced above could be considered a dashboard. But I suspect you want something more than static data. That's where you need to be very clear about describing all the functionality that you want in that dashboard tool (i.e. I want the email address to be a hyperlink that opens my email manager and composes an email to the listing agent with this information or I want the MLS number to be a clickable link that opens all the property pictures in separate windows). And while you're doing this, keep in mind that Zillow already has a very sophisticated \"dashboard\". It's that tool that comes up whenever you visit zillow.com. Zillow has probably already dumped millions of dollars into developing their dashboard tool with all the functionality that it offers. So, if you're imagining a \"dashboard\" similar to what Zillow already offers, then a million dollars is probably a good place to start for the sake of budgeting."

Often, programs will maintain multiple sources of randomness independently - each with their own state that doesn't influence the others - which allows the order to be predictable for some, but not others. Imagine a casino: each deck of cards is not dependent on a single shuffler for the whole building. It is important that no matter what order you explore a minecraft map, the generated map be the same for the same seed, which is why you'd probably do exactly what you described and make the seed function for one region dependent on its location and a \"global\" seed, but in other cases it is very, very common to have more than one randomized sequence from which you can draw, and it is not necessary for these independent processes to pre-generate their sequences provided the state of the generators is separate.",

Then, as soon as someone crossed into another chunk, you'd use the already-saved seed to generate the chunk, which would generate and save seeds for all of its adjacent chunks too. In that case it wouldn't matter who took the action or what action was taken to generate the next chunk.

So you can do things like calculate a sorted list of the best available options, then have a random chance to not pick the top of the list. Or you can add arbitrary delays, or random additions to movement directions. The AI in Pong might just never move the paddle at full speed, or have a lag in \"noticing\" the ball has bounced and changed directions, or have some momentum so it sometimes \"overshoots\" the ball and misses, etc. Pretty much any kind of screwup you can imagine, if you can imagine it specifically then you are describing something you can implement.

For example one thing I did not see happening is using LLMs to reanalyze old SETI data. That would be an interesting project.",
        "It's actually quite funny, because I have had two different professors, one a mathematician and the other a computer scientist, express disparate opinions on the matter. The mathematician was able to essentially \"gaslight\" ChatGPT into giving an absolutely bonkers proof (I forget of what, but it was very rudimentary) that had no basis in actual math, but it was 100% \"certain\" about. As they put it, \"the light's on but nobody's home.\" The computer scientist, on the other hand, spent at least an hour telling their students that AI is going to replace all of us, and that if we didn't already know the best algorithm for every imaginable scenario, we were already obsolete. Just outright telling us that a probabilistic model with no sense of logical rules could out-think every last one of us. Therein lies the issue, I think. Generative AI is based primarily on probability and statistics, not logic. Back before deep learning became a thing, we tried building AI that worked completely off of logical rules, or with things like fuzzy-logic neural nets. Rules-based AI is inherently labor-intensive, because humans have to program all of the rules and have a deep understanding of the underlying problem. Modern AI doesn't have this limitation; you can train a neural network to approximate any function without it having any logical \"understanding\" of the problem. Now, this is really appealing to CEOs because that means you just throw a lot of data at increasingly-complex models; you're essentially brute-forcing the problem. Sometimes that's good enough, so choosing between AI or domain experts might become an optimization problem itself. The danger is if something goes catastrophically wrong, then a large-language model isn't going to be able to tell you **why** something went wrong. All it understands is probabilities. That's just not how humans think, though. We build internal models and develop schemas and understand logic. Most importantly, we have enough executive function to self-correct if an idea or conclusion sounds wrong, i.e. a \"gut check.\" Generative AI doesn't do that. If you could train an AI to \"hallucinate\" a solution to a problem, then run it by a logic-based module that can accurately determine whether the potential solution is correct or not, then we should start worrying. Ultimately, these large language models do not \"think\" like humans do, so there will always be a disconnect between AI usefulness and the human skills they're trying to emulate. Now, if AI became so ubiquitous that it literally changes how humans think, like some kind of dystopian feedback loop, then we could have some serious problems, e.g. \"Idiocracy\".",

For me \"people say about AI...\" is practically meaningless, it's like listening to Flat Earthers about astronomy, they don't know what they're talking about, and often are moving \\*away\\* from knowing what they're talking about. It really is hard to overstate just how ignorant the average person, the media, and even most software developers are about AI.

It can also do the work that researchers solved about 10 years ago, mostly because that stuff now appears in cs courses that are published online. It can help with other stuff, but it can\u2019t do it on its own.

You can think of the rise of AI similar to the industrial revolution but on a much faster timelines. Technical skills (hard skills) will be abstracted, in so far as the barrier of entry goes. You\u2019ll have a lot of people who never wrote a single line of code (me for example, outside of R back during my masters program) being able to create apps and such from scratch. But that\u2019s like saying someone who never baked being able to follow instructions and bake a pie. There are levels to complexity and the those who are truly excellent and knowledgeable in their craft will be able to leverage AI the most \u2014 why? Because AI excels at simple, structured task. The best ones can handle more complex tasks, but the key here is structure. You need to know exactly what you want, understand how it might interact with things you might build in the future, and then break tasks down into component pieces in order to fully utilize the potential for AI. This level of synthesis, critical thinking, and creativity doesn\u2019t come from some who has never coded or dabbled in the field before. To say AI will replace experts is ridiculous. **AI will make it more apparent who the real experts are** and the best examples of this you can see during the dot-com bubble to now. Before it used to cost tens of thousands to get a site up, now, you have so many tools that will build you one for free. But if you think you can take a template or broiler plate website and turn it into say an Amazon or Netflix, that would be impossible. Likewise, for math, statistics, really anything where before, you had to have an extensive background and might be unable to just \u201cstart from scratch,\u201d AI will provide you with a platform to take the dive and swim in shallow waters. Just because it\u2019s easier to wade in the pool doesn\u2019t mean you try your hand at the open ocean. Experience, innovation, and synthesis all these things that make someone the top of their field, AI won\u2019t be able to replace.

      "output": [
        "It is certainly possible to have no undefined behaviors. (For example, a Turing Machine itself is fully defined.) Most languages choose to leave corner cases undefined to help compiler writers take advantage of hardware. This is typically done in places where IRL there *wouldn't* be any difference. For example, in scheme [a language which is pretty simple and pretty carefully defined], I was surprised to learn it is *not* constrained what order function-arguments get evaluated in:  when calling `foo(expr1,expr2)` it's not guaranteed that `expr1` is evaluated before `expr2` is. That's because (a) it lets the compiler take advantages of multiple cores or other parallelism, and (b) it's uncommon in scheme to use mutation, so evaluating `expr1` rarely changes what `expr2` might evaluate to. ...And I was about to write that C++ *does* require left-to-right evaluation, but I was [mistaken]: the snippet `int n=5;  foo(n, n++);` might end up calling `foo(5,6)` *or* `foo(6,6)` (undefined behavior). Another example: consider the contents of a freshly-allocated array. In C++ the initial contents could be anything, while in Java the initial contents are guaranteed all zeroes. This means the Java compiler will probably add code that explicitly zero-initializes the array, even if the the programmer's code immediately proceeds to initialize the array in some other way themselves \u2014 wasting time. But Java prioritizes consistency over efficiency. (Note that the Java compiler is presumably allowed to skip zero'ing the contents, *if* it can look at the code and verify that the programmer's code initializes each location before ever using it. That might be easy in many common situations, but it can't *always* determine when it's safe to avoid initializing \u2014 that'd be equivalent to the Halting Problem! So the compiler would have to be conservative, and still perform the zero-initialization whenever it's not able to totally reason about the programmer's-initialization-loop. To make things much much worse IRL, Java has to worry about having zero'd contents if an exception gets thrown (and caught somewhere higher up), like an Out of Memory exception. So even String[] names = new String[2]; names[0] = someFunctionThatWillReturn(\"hi\"); names[1]=\"bye\"; it probably needs to set `names[1]` to `null` before it calls `someFunctionThatWillReturn(\"hi\")`, and then only after that succeeds (without throwing exceptions) is it allowed to assign `\"bye\"` to `names[1]`.) The C++ compiler's \"undefined behavior\" means it doesn't have to worry about any of this, and assumes the programmer has fully thought everything through [or more likely, that the programmer doesn't care about the array-contents if there's an out-of-memory error].",
        "I think it's important to bear in mind the difference between knowing what a _statement_ does and knowing what a _program_ does. The kind of \"undefined behavior\" talked about with regard to programming languages is that we might encounter a given line of code, in a known state of the program, and not know what the actual effect of that line would be. This is not possible in Turing machines, or other programming-language-ish constructs that fully define their own behavior. But this is very different from knowing whether a program will halt! We can know exactly what effect each step has in a given state, and yet not know whether the \"accept\" state will ever actually be reached. This is an important result of Turing and G\u00f6del: our inability to prove theorems, solve halting problems, etc., does not stem from a deficiency in the way we express those problems, and thus cannot be solved by eliminating \"undefined behavior\" or its mathematical analogues. Our notation can be _perfect_, and still we have the undecidability/inconsistency problem."

On the discovery side, RSS lets you what you subscribe to. If you want to see everything on ICanHasCheeseburger than, great. But how do you see all the latest meme creator sites? On the ranking and curation side, there are no upvotes or downvotes. Maybe I want to see a few memes from ICanHasCheeseburger, but only the best ones. You cannot go viral on RSS. Using RSS doesn't get you away from the algorithm. It just means that you have to fight the algorithm on the initial discovery side to get a subscription. For an example where RSS is being used but an algorithm is still important, consider podcasting. Podcasts use RSS and once someone subscribes to you, you have a direct link. But getting discovered, well that part still very much relies on whatever algorithm says ok. RSS is great if you have a handful of blogs you know and respect and want to follow everything they say. It's perfect for webcomics, which are small updates where you probably want to reach each page as it comes. It's not great for community generated content, though, and if you look at reddit, that's the entire value proposition, user generated content. The users make the content for other users to read, the users vote on the content to curate it for other users, and reddit sells the ads while producing nothing except the engine that lets users interact with one another. That's not to slag on reddit, it's a valuable service, but its one where users generate a lot of crap so you need curation.",

However, most Linuxes do have server versions that don't have desktop environments. And if you're just SSHing into a server anyway, then a GUI isn't even going to be used. Windows likes to make tools that are accessible to a wide range of people. Its all very obvious and discoverable - you can click around and find what you want usually. But there are also tools that are designed for people who will actually put in a little bit of effort to *learn* that tool. It takes effort up front and the way that the tool works may not be obvious. You might not be able to figure it out without looking it up. It may have benefits and features that are not discoverable - you need to seek out this functionality. If you're willing to make your tool a little opaque at first glance, then you can create a tool that is ultimately easier, more pleasant, and more powerful and versatile than a dumbed-down GUI interface. A casual user might not be willing to learn a handful of Unix command line tools (that you can combine with piping). But if you're a professional user and you're expected to really know your tools and job inside out, then you will learn them, just as any craftsmen has to learn their tools and get good at them. Programming languages are themselves an example of this: you can make what-you-see-is-what-you-get GUI website builders, but a professional will need to know and master HTML a programming language. But, again, any desktop Linux is going to have a GUI for damned near everything nowadays anyway.

The most helpful, specific, and practical lessons on OOP I've come across have come from the C++ community, and specifically from Bjarne Stroustrup, the guy who created C++. Public inheritance, that description says, is substitutability. Inherit, not to reuse, but to *be* reused. I've noticed that tree structures -- such as a compiler syntax tree or a web DOM tree -- usually benefit from the substitutable behavior that inheritance provides. The Clang compiler, for example, has a base (substitutable) class [Expr], and the DOM has a base (substitutable) interface [Node]. The substitutable behavior that inheritance provides allows us to interact with many kinds of expressions or many kinds of nodes in a uniform way. I think the PHP framework [Symfony] also uses inheritance well, and the substitutable behavior of its [KernalInterface] was useful when, for example, [Drupal was re-written using Symfony]. And when I was following Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters, [I used inheritance in the garbage collector], because every base (substitutable) collectable object needed to uniformly support mark and trace."

        "So the code your computer is using to run the operating system actively is imported to ram from storage when you boot up by the bios. This means the actual operating system that's running is stored in ram while the actual base instructions are stored on disc and only used when you boot up. This is actually why some of your ram will show as unusable or \"system reserved.\" Updating the operating system only changes the os code stored on your storage disc, so if the update makes a change needed for the active operating system, like many security related updates do, then the computer needs to first change the stored operating system, then shut down so it can load the new instructions into ram along with the rest of the operating system all at the same time.",
        "It's a state issue. Running software can be in any number of states, and each one may need different handling in an update routine. It's almost always easier and more reliable to require that piece of software to restart after updating it, so that it starts from a known, standard state. In the case of a kernel or drivers, you've got the same software issues, but also have the state of the hardware to keep in mind. Some hardware may not have a known/documented way to uninitialize/reinitialize it without an actual reboot, and even if it does, it's still easier to rely on the single hardware-init path (startup) that's required for normal use anyhow.",
        "Suppose you have some kind of application - a web server, let's say - running on a Linux system. (The following discussion is applicable to other operating systems, but I'm arbitrarily picking one so I can go into specific detail.) What this means is that at some point, the code of the web server was loaded into memory, and at that time, its external linker symbols were resolved against the system's installed dynamic libraries. As one example, the web server almost certainly requires libc. So libc is loaded into memory alongside the web server. Now you update libc, to fix some critical bug or security vulnerability or what have you. The update process writes a new copy of libc to disk, but the old copy is still loaded into memory in the running web server. So you don't actually have the benefit of the update until you restart the web server. Could the web server update to a new libc without restarting? Maybe, but it would be quite difficult. The web server presumably has many network sockets and disk files open at any given time, each of which is a libc reference. So either libc itself needs to be able to pass all this data from one copy to another, or the web server needs to be able to close all these references before reloading libc. Both of these involve temporarily stopping all activity, which looks a lot like a restart. So why go to all this effort, when the result will be an operation 90% as disruptive as doing a restart? So we have to restart the web server. But by the same argument, we have to restart _every_ service, since all of them use libc. Again, we _could_ just do a \"restart all services\" operation without rebooting, but again, this would be 90% as disruptive as a reboot, so why not just reboot. There are some schemes for avoiding reboots during updates. For example, ksplice allows hot patching the Linux kernel. But these systems are more trouble than they're worth for all but the enterprisiest of enterprise users. And once in a blue moon there is an update that just can't be done without a hardware restart, like a firmware update to some piece of hardware that only accepts firmware at startup.",
        "There are a variety of reasons you might want to do a restart as part of an update procedure. On modern computing platforms, the platform will \"lock\" certain areas of memory and platform registers during startup and boot. Once locked, these resources cannot be changed by any component in the system until reboot. In particular, most BIOS patches will require a reboot because the BIOS image is locked after startup so that the only way it can be changed is upon a reset. The patch itself is actually applied during the next boot. If you enable the Secure Boot feature, then a similar restriction may apply to the OS kernel. The BIOS itself controls what kernel can be booted on the system as long as Secure Boot is enabled and changes may require a reset. There are many similar reasons you might want your update code to run during reset (before other apps can be loaded which might present a security threat).",
        "TL;DR: Software is easier to update when it's not being run or is restarted. Some core parts of the operating system can't be updated without rebooting, others can, and some others sort of can but may be easier to handle reliably with a restart. Changing software code or data on the fly while it's being run is a lot more complicated than shutting the program down, updating the files on the disk or permanent storage, and starting the software again with the updated code. Some parts of your computer's software could easily be updated without restarting the entire system. For example, if your web browser is updated, it should be enough to completely shut down the browser and restart it, without restarting the entire operating system. The same goes for applications in general. However, some parts of the operating system such as the kernel (the core of the operating system) will keep running as long as the OS is running, and restarting the very core means restarting the entire operating system. In addition to applications, some less central parts of the operating system can also be restarted individually without restarting the entire system. Those would probably include at least some of the background services of the OS. Some components could at least in principle be updated without restarting the entire system but can be trickier in practice. For example, shared libraries contain common code or functionality that can be used by any number of programs on the system. Updating a shared library that's being used by multiple running applications or other programs would require restarting all of those programs that use the library. Windows won't actually even allow a file that's being kept open by any running process to be deleted or modified, so even replacing the file with an updated version may require shutting down all dependent software first. Some other operating systems such as Linux handle things in a somewhat different way and allow for (superficially) replacing a file in the file system despite the file being in use, but the old version is actually kept around as long as it's being kept open by any running process. If you update a program's executable, or a shared library or some other file that the program is using, the OS allows for replacing the file and the program might keep chugging happily along, but the changes don't actually apply to the program until it's restarted. So, if operating system vendors want to make sure that an update is actually applied to all running software, by far the easiest way of doing that is to restart everything. That would be particularly important for security updates. Modifying running code is possible but generally a lot harder to do reliably and without breaking things.",
        "Well with some systems, they didn't but it was clustered. You could have three systems with the possibility of shutting any one of the three systems down. With a cluster, each system has its own memory so the coupling is fairly loose. The systems could always fall back to using previous versions of the cluster protocol. Uptime can be measured in years if you wanted."

        "The ELI5 version is that the \"assembly\" that the compilers convert to *is* binary. You kind of have two versions of assembly: the human readable version with ASCII text, and then you have the hexadecimal/binary representation of the opcodes themselves that the CPU can execute directly. Compilers that are producing an executable are converting your code to *this* \"assembly\" (not the ASCII kind) although really it's just machine language. I don't think that anyone actually on a day-to-day basis using their compilers to convert, say, C++ code, to human-readable x86 assembly. It's usually converted into the binary machine language.",
        "Lots of strange answers here ... The main reason is that most compilers target multiple CPU architectures (X86, ARM, ...). Converting to an intermediate language (IL) allows you to decouple the language to IL and IL to binary steps. Otherwise you'd need to have a somewhat custom language to binary pipeline for each combination. Also this allows you to do generic optimisations on the IL level, which is a very good place to do them, because it's language and CPU agnostic, and can contain additional Infos that would be stripped in the final binary. Again this saves work over having to implement it for each language or each CPU architecture.",
        "Compilers, like many computer programs, are made up of a number of components, where each of these components has one job and has fairly well defined inputs and outputs. The reason for this is that in a large system, a developer can't hold all of it in their head at once, so by breaking it into components it's (mostly) safe to ignore components you're not currently working on. So the assembler is a separate component. A compiler will typically have many other components (often called \"passes\" in a compiler) that take one representation of the code and output another, and you can think of the assembler as the last pass.",
        "Assembly IS binary instructions, with one level of abstraction: mnemonics to represent processor opcodes instead of having to memorize long strings of binary digits directly. Why is it difficult to convert a high-level language directly to binary? There's probably 100 years of research on that topic. Look up \"computational linguistics\", \"terminal\" vs \"nonterminal\" symbols, production (replacement) rules, context-sensitive and context-free grammars, parsing algorithms, and compiler design.",

        "Given a huge database of what people typed and what their eventual search query actually was, you can build a Markov chain - a data structure that gives probabilities for the next state given the current one. You can then use this to predict the final search query given whatever has been typed so far. The big sites then apply various kinds of \"special sauce\" to this - prioritizing things similar to what you've searched for recently, or products they're trying to unload, or what have you - so that \"preferred\" items (whatever that means) float to the top. Doing this with a time budget of a few milliseconds at the scale of Google is an astounding exercise in distributed computation, of course.",
        "Something like the search bar in Amazon is extremely complex. The real special stuff is in the rankings - deciding how to sort the results so you see the most important stuff. That's pretty complicated and probably uses a bunch of signals (including machine learning). It may also be personalized - so that different users see different results. But it's also hard to know exactly how the rankings are done (although I could speculate). In terms of actually finding things that match the user's request (and doing it fast), there's some interesting algorithmic stuff happening. Firstly, a query like \"4k tv\" is so common that it's going to be cached. The result page for it is precomputed and stored in memory on servers so it can be served extremely quickly. How to build these kind of distributed caches is an interesting topic of its own, but I'll skip it. For a query that's not cached (or to populate the cache), you actually need to find and sort all of the matches for a given search. There are a few techniques to make this happen really fast for a large set of items (usually these are called \"documents\" in a search engine). Firstly, you will assign a unique id to each thing (e.g. like a product id). Then you might split the set of all documents into manageable subsets (aka shards). For each shard, you can build an \"index\" - a mapping from terms into a list of documents that contain them. To do a search, you look up each term (for example, \"4k\" and \"tv\") in the index. Then there's a join that finds the intersection of documents containing all terms. A common data structure for these indices is some kind of [trie], which allows going from the term to the list of document ids. The ids themselves are usually sorted and stored in an extremely compressed form, perhaps alongside data structures that allow skipping forward (which is useful to optimize intersecting the lists). Real search engines have fancy versions of a trie to compress it as much as possible. In general, you need the trie to fit in memory. You can size the shards so that one server can hold the trie index for that shard in it's memory. So to run a search, a coordinator passes the search to a set of servers covering all of the shards (you may have replicas of these for fault tolerance or to support more queries per second). Each shard server does a trie lookup for each term, and then does an intersection on the list of documents matching the terms. That gives a list of all documents in the shard matching the search. Then the shard server will sort those by the ranking and return the top N to the coordinator. The coordinator takes all of the shard results and merges them together, and returns the top N of that to the user. In practice there may be further complications. For example, you may want to have a smaller set of \"better\" documents with higher rankings. Then you'll have one copy of this system for that set, and another copy of the entire system that serves everything else. Most of the time for common queries, you only need to look at the first set, because you'll always have enough results from those higher ranked things (and the other matches wouldn't show up on the page anyway since they were outranked). Only if that gives no results does the search fall back to the full index.",
        "I don't know how Amazon search works. Someone else shared a link that may explain that. I can tell you that some large Wikipedia search works via things like [ElasticSearch] that are built specifically for this use case. So your search query doesn't directly hit your application's database (relational or otherwise), it hits a representation of that data specifically designed for that purpose."

For your purposes, I would just define the most important or atomic feature of your project. Then determine the additional features starting with the more important ones, maybe limit yourself to 5 bigger ones. Write all of this down in notes before writing any code. This will be your map, essentially. I'll use creating a Word Processor as an example. The most important feature is probably being able to write text into a window that opens when the project is run. That's it - this would be the first part to get working. The next most important feature is being able to save that text to a file. After that, opening a saved file into the program - you might be able to lump these two together as a feature. After handling the file stuff, you'd probably move on to adding the ability to style the text in the processor. Maybe the next thing after that is the ability to have multiple windows or tabs with different files open. Each of these individual features would also get this same treatment. In order to save a file, I need to open a file prompt, work with the filesystem, determine which file format you'll need to support, determine logic for saving a file that already exists, and probably display the saved filename at the top of the window that's editing it. You would do this for the most important features and sub-features before writing any code. You don't have to have everything perfectly laid out before starting, but you definitely want to have a plan and know how to start each piece (and each piece of a piece, etc). I do want to stress the importance of actually writing all of this down somewhere. It will make your plan more concrete by forcing you to walk through it. Then, as you begin coding your project, you will invariably encounter issues you didn't expect or plan for and may need to figure out how to incorporate these into the plan you made. These could be minor or quite large issues. The complexity would determine if you need to go through this same process again for the newly discovered issue.

      "output": [
        "You might want to explore from the other direction, and look at simple microcontrollers, such as an Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico. All of these are typically programmed using a compiled (i.e. machine code) programme *flashed* to the non-volatile memory. When power is applied to the microcontroller, after some basic setup, control is passed to the first code of the user programme. It is responsible for everything. It will take advantage of a small amount of \"hard coded\" routines, but most things will have to be done by the programme, including switching between different tasks, managing memory carefully, changing states, any UI, as required. It can get very tiresome to write code to deal with specific devices that are connected to a microcontroller, such as a temperature sensor, so typically you will write the code for this once (or find such code written by someone else) and always include that in your programme code for compilation. There are many variations of devices that can be connected so overtime, libraries of code will build up that abstract things a little further and provide a standardise way of communicating with certain specific types of connected devices. This would be an API. Within the library, specific code will be added to handle each common variation of similar devices in their own specific ways. Sometimes these adaptions will be provided by the component makers. Slowly, more complex libraries build up, more remote/abstracted from the devices controlled. Consider the [FastLED] library for Ardunio which provides control of a wide range of LEDs. As the programmes get increasingly complex, many of the activities handled by operating systems and more complex systems will start to appear. This will apply if monitoring multiple sensors, input devices, displays where there is a need to appropriate share time between tasks and respond to outside events. An operating system is taking the principle of abstraction much further, but is essentially more of the same, with more and more higher level capabilities being incorporated into the compiled OS programme to relieve an application programmer of a lot of mundane activities. An operating system will comprise many layers of code, some closer to the hardware than others (or at least, to abstractions of hardware, and using APIs for device drivers that close the gap to the actual hardware). For some operating systems, such as Windows, the compilation of application code is now often not directly to machine code but to some interim state taking advantage of operating systems frameworks that use just in time compilation at time of execution. An operating system is a huge collection of many competing and complementary components. Most mainstream operating systems are Time Sharing based, using scheduling approaches in particular. Another important class is real time operating systems (RTOS) which are event driven and preemptive. Everything has to be achieved within specific constraints. These operating systems tend to be much leaner than general purpose operating systems. Learning to programme a $2 - $10 microcontroller can teach a lot. Increasingly, a lot of modern microcontrollers can now also be programmed in Python. Actually, one of a couple of cut-down version of Python with microcontroller specific additions, namely *micropython* and *circuit python*. These can be used to both run Python code in the usual way, and to run Python interactive sessions. Unsurprisingly, this is achieved by another programme compiled to machine code and flashed to the microcontroller, which runs on boot and provides these interesting Python capabilities. As electronics get more complex, the capabilities increase, and more abstraction is introduced so we move higher up the stack.",
        "On some very basic systems, \"printing a string\" is nothing more than writing to a particular region of memory. The hardware does the rest. With some carefully written C code (mostly of the \"yes, I know what I'm doing, get out of the way\" kind) that can be done in C alone. But where things are more complicated, the C code will typically be linked against some code written in assembly, and the hardware-specific stuff will be in that assembly code. That's really no different from ordinary non-OS code making system calls. \"System calls\" don't exist in C.",
        "Its quite simple really, as someone who did just that You first write bootloader in assembly (there is no other way since you must access specific instructions (for x86) which you can't when using a compiler, such as switching from 16 bit mode to 'real mode'). Then in assembly you jump to code that is starting at specific address, and then you compile the ISO such that the C/C++ code will be in that specific location. Then, C/C++ takes from there. Its called jumping to the kernel.",
        "Many of the lowest level bits of the operating system, at least in the past, were written in assembler. These would be loaded onto the machine in known memory locations. They would have code at the top of the routine that would look up parameters in other known memory locations, like the stack, and put any results back in known places, like the stack. The language compiler would be modified to put parameters from the language into those locations in the right order. Presto, now you can call these basic functions from your language. So, for instance, if you have a realtime clock that constantly puts its value in memory locations 44 through 47, you might have a tiny assembler routine that copies those values onto the stack in the order that your computer considers to be a 32-bit int. Your compiler adds a similar stub that simply jumps to that code. Now you can say t = timer() in your code, that jumps to the routine, that drops the value on the stack, your language copies that value into the memory location for i, and now you have the time in i. At some point your libraries reach the point that you don\u2019t bother with the assembler and write the code in C and it\u2019s tied directly to the bits of memory and/or IO channels. That was always the case in Unix, but in the 80s there were lots of different languages and OSes",

        "A system call is a mechanism for relatively unprivileged code (usually userland applications, but other OS architectures may use privilege differently) to request privileged code (usually the kernel) to do things. Privileged code has access to instructions and registers that unprivileged code doesn't, for things like talking to hardware and configuring the MMU. Since C compilers won't generate code that uses these instructions or registers, sections of kernel code that use them are typically written in assembly. Although nowadays you can write a very basic kernel that doesn't contain assembly. On a UEFI system, the firmware exposes a library of functions that the OS can just call, so as long as you configure the compiler with the right calling conventions, if these functions are sufficient for you, you can write a basic kernel.",

        "You don't need syscalls, those are used for security reasons to not give all programs high level access. OSes have high level access, so they can do things directly. How does Linux print to the screen? It uses a TTY virtual file, to act as a terminal interface. Programs read and write from this file over \"pipes\" called Stdin/Stdout/stderr. These are all OS abstractions, at the end of the day this is just a chunk of memory acting as a buffer. When a program \"prints\", it writes to its Stdout, which then is written by the OS to this file. A terminal emulator is reading the file over Stdin, and gets this information once written. It then uses a GUI library to change pixel colors in a window according to a font. How are pixels changed? At the end of the day, your computer has an array of graphics memory. Writing a value to this array causes dedicated graphics hardware to send a pixel value to a monitor according to the value written. The monitor activates a voltage for the pixel which changes the pixel color. Exactly how this occurs depends on the monitor type (VGA, HDMi, etc). Drivers abstract these different standards away, so GUI programs don't need to worry about what type of monitor is connected. But the OS does. It needs drivers for each type of monitor hardware. Syscalls are simply a way of a user space program telling the OS to do something for it. The OS needs the actual implementation of these utilities at a low level. What OSes do have for hardware is CPU interrupts. These are signals sent by hardware (or the OS) to interrupt execution and do something else. The OS defines a hardware interrupt table to specify what to do when an interrupt occurs. So essentially: as an OS writer you will need to interface with the graphics hardware directly. You will need to handle different types of hardware like VGA, HDMI, etc. you will need to write to graphics memory yourself. You will need to translate character bytes into pixel bitmaps using font files. You will use hardware interrupts to intercept keystrokes and provide these to programs. You will write your own syscalls libraries for user space programs to work with.",
        "The short answer is you don't, there are always some very awkward corners that need a few lines of assembly.  The long answer is that's OK, you can write 99.9% in C or C++. Most compilers these days even have backdoors that allow you to embed a few lines of assembly in line with the rest of your C code.  It also depends on your CPU, by referring to syscalls, it more or less implies you are talking about a CPU with a protected OS mode. You can write (most of) that protect OS mode in C or C++ and the syscall is merely a way of insulating the operating system from the wild wild west of random stuff the user may run in user mode.  However, many of the cheaper / smaller embedded cpu's don't even have a protected mode.",
        "The most base layer way for software to communicate with computer hardware is by writing to designated areas of memory, buses, or dedicated registers that the hardware checks, like pidgeon holes. The OS kernel and drivers do this to talk to the GPU and other stuff like that. Above that, you have ordinary machine code loaded up in RAM, some from the OS, some from drivers, etc. An app just has to call into a function that sits at a particular address to talk to it. So, you can talk to the GL driver by calling a known function that can tell you where the function pointers for the GL driver are, then you can call into those function pointers to do things like create textures, draw triangles, etc.  So, to answer your question. It depends on what you want your OS to do. You can write an OS kernel to talk to hardware drivers to control the different parts of your physical computer.  If you were wondering about the chicken or the egg scenario with C compilers themselves written in C, someone had to write the first C compiler by hand."

        "First, enshittification takes time. A lot of developers are boiled frogs in this regard. Second, if may not be immediately obvious on the \u201cobjective\u201d difference between something that furthers enshittification vs not, from a daily feature & bug standpoint. Especially in larger companies you\u2019re only managing a small part of the overall process. Third, these changes are usually preceded by changes in management, organization, funding, etc. that itself causes the good talent to leave (whether directly or indirectly). I\u2019ve never seen someone stand up and die on this hill. They just open LinkedIn after the meeting.",
        "As others have said, programmers generally have no decision making power. But also, the modern enshittification pattern is largely around a specific type of company where you grow very quickly by shoveling money into a furnace for a few years and then turn up whatever screws you have to extract revenue from the very large base of users you spent billions of dollars to acquire \u2014 that\u2019s sort of how we define enshittification. And that\u2019s a company that has likely been paying people with a lot of equity. So people inside that company may be like, \"this sure does make our product worse, but we\u2019re not making any money, the market is angry about it, and my options are either going to be worth $2,000,000 or literally nothing, so let\u2019s give it a go\". You can live comfortably on say $150k annual salary, but the idea that you wouldn\u2019t be motivated by money after that is wrong. The difference between \"I can pay my bills every month and afford to live comfortably\" and \"my company successfully went public and the 100k options given to me at $0.50 are now worth $70\" is unfathomably large.",

It's not a recurring payment faucet you can turn on * You are currently shipping a bloated C++ application package, that runs on overpriced Windows machines that you force your clients to buy, and your support staff handles the update process manually. You will need to invest in a significant or complete rewrite in order to distribute your software over the internet * Existing clients will be pissed and they will leave if you force them into a recurring payment model without meaningfully improving the product at the same time My direct manager pretty much said \"whatever, just implement a forced login form\" and I don't think the feedback ever got anywhere near the decision makers.

        "Hot take -- you basically can't work in software if you DONT want to work on an immoral product. Its almost impossible, meaning, of 100 jobs, maybe 3 are not based on an immoral strategy. Almost every company gathers mass user data, and holds it ransom to force / keep users engaged. It is THE software model of the 2020s+, of reddit, instagram, facebook, amazon, google, adobe, figma, Valve, EA, Unity, and almost every company one can dream of. That is almost every single business on earth right now. So working on software, and with data, almost immediately puts you into an organization at odds with users. Because there is no contrast, its actually hard (as a dev) to even understand the abuse inherent in the system. I only could because during my schooling I took philosophy courses, and started to see how we were all developing software using a \"mafia\" model -- holding users ransom once they get hooked. I personally hated this so much, that I started day dreaming about \"portable personal data\", meaning each user stores a fragment of other peoples data, and the apps become data-less processors. This has ended up being my whole personal career over the last 10 years -- but there is NO DEMAND for this kind of business model, as it is less profitable, so I run [Decelium.com] for free, volunteering my time. How do I make money? I make money by working in traditional business and pour my spare time into my personal project, hoping that one day the world cares and something like Decelium (or another similar dev pattern) becomes the status quo. So I would be surprised if any \"normal\" developer is even in a position to answer this question honestly. To answer this questions one has to be away of non abusive or non \"mafia\" like business models, which have been mostly eradicated. I explained it to my GF like this. Imagine you bought your desk, and you had to \"rent\" it each month after buying it to keep access to the stuff you stored inside. If you piss off the wrong person, or violate any random term, or lapse on your payments, someone is allowed to enter your home and destroy the desk, and any property inside of it. You also are not allowed to ever legally remove or own data from the desk, and once you place something inside, it is the property of (lets say) Ikea. Sounds insane. This is almost every digital product today. Even Google Drive -- if you share a document or ever make it public, it becomes Google property in that moment. So crazy.

So for example, if a designer wants a button that does xyz, a programmer can air their grievances but ultimately, they either add it or get fired. If however a higher up says to do something in the code or use a system a specific way, the programmer lead can veto and say \"no we're not going to do that\"."

Otherwise, for how to remember things, some tips include: * For short quick things that you don't want to forget for that random future time you need them, sometimes a sticky note in a visible spot can help. (eg: \"Scanner is on port 3!\"). Helps if you have a dedicated place for these that you will always look at. * For how to solve particular problems, posting it somewhere like Stackoverflow (self-answered question) is a good way to document the solution in a way that you can always find it. And it helps others with the same problem too. * For more complex things, I would maintain an internal Wiki. This could work for your example. Create a page for that framework and document everything you don't want to forget about it. Include links to documentation, fixes for common problems, steps to install things, etc.etc. This works really well in some cases, but the information can become outdated over time as well."

Since ML is about inferring models from data, it also practically involves lots of processing of that data in order to make it useful for the algorithm: combining, normalizing, converting, deciding what to do with dirty or missing values, etc. If you've worked on statistical data using something like R or perhaps Matlab, you already have experience doing those kinds of things. Building software systems that make use of machine learning involves more software engineering: building data processing pipelines in some data processing system, integrating the ML system into whatever larger system of which it needs to be a part, etc. However, for strictly research-oriented purposes those may not be as important.

Languages like Java and Python use references instead of pointers to refer to objects, but the idea for this use case is the same there.",
        "Linked Lists for example. There are a lot of modern languages (Java, JavaScript, Python) that avoid exposing the programmer to pointers, but have to use pointers internally to refer to objects or to implement the data structures. Even C/C++, the pointeriest of languages, has been adding features that let you avoid thinking about them most of the time.",
        "In most modern languages, most of the pointer functionalities are implemented in some other way, so you don't have to use them. But in C for example, that is not the case. If you want to pass an array in C, you have to pass a pointer to the first element. If you want to modify a variable that is outside of a function's scope, you have to pass a pointer. You can use them in more complex data structures like linked lists, graphs and trees. In a linked list for example, every element is an independent object that points to the next one on the list. If you had an array and wanted to put an object in the middle, you'd have to move half the other objects to the right. But here, you just need to change the pointers. This makes a lot of operations faster and easier. Granted, you won't probably need to implement a linked list from scratch, but this is how it works under the hood.",
        "If you are interfacing with an operating system, sometimes you need to know specific memory addresses that the system is using. If C only had variables, then it would be hard to access the specific memory location. This is more of an issue in Machine/Assembly Language, where you need to interface with the operating system in a more fundamental way, and don't have libraries/functions that wall everything off from view. The idea of C was always to be a middle ground between assembly language and a high level language. Its probably more a high level language than a low level language, but it retains the ability to manage memory directly. Other high level languages only let you store data in variables of various forms and completely hide the memory of the computer from you.",
        "Shared mutable state. Any time you want multiple parts of your program to refer to the same value, and to have changes to that value seen everywhere. If I do x=3 then y=x then x=4, y will still be 3. You need pointers to say that x and y see all the same state changes. Also, recursively defined structures like trees and linked lists are impossible without pointers because you can't statically know how big the data is, so you just keep a pointer to the sub-structures."

      "output": [
        "By programmers do you mean hobbyists/students or do you mean professionals on the job? Hobbyists/students have difficulty learning things. Maybe they didn't pay attention or care during a databases/SQL class or maybe they had to do a bug fix in a codebase for a homework assignment and couldn't figure out how to do it. Those previous two sentences describe things that happened when I was getting my Computer Science degree. Oh, also I had issues with teamwork and cooperation with others on a team project. Teamwork is very important in the real world, professional software developers usually work in teams. Professionals on the job have to learn things too just like students do but they also have other difficulties. Professional programmers usually work in teams on a codebase that was created before they joined the team. The codebase can be massive, maybe millions of lines of code. They have to make bug fixes in that code and add features to it, and in order for them to be able to do that they must be able to read and understand the code. Reading and understanding code that other people wrote is really hard. I personally have more difficulty doing that than writing my own code by myself from scratch. Each codebase has its own structure and architecture that you must learn. Hopefully there is a senior (like 5+ years of experience) or staff/principal (like 10+ years of experience) developer who can explain it to you and maybe show you some pre-recorded video or documentation detailing and explaining the codebase. A codebase for work can take four months to two years to learn, depending on the codebase. There is a lot of code in a codebase. So yeah, that's a big problem. You have to make bug fixes and add features in that massive, hard to understand mess of code. Most beginners and newcomers think the code is a mess that is impossible to understand when they start, and their natural inclination is to want to rewrite everything from scratch in a way that they fully understand. A full rewrite is usually a bad idea even though you may feel you want to do it. A codebase that looks like an impossible to understand mess to you may make perfect sense and be easy to navigate to the person who initially created it and built it out from the beginning. It is better if this person with experience teaches you the codebase. It takes time to learn a codebase, and often the person paying you doesn't want to spend the time training you. Usually the person paying you just wants to see results for their money ASAP. There is this expression \"adding more new people to a late software project makes it later\". The new people need to learn the codebase and be trained by the old people, and doing so takes time away from the old people that they could be spending working on the codebase. Often the person paying and hiring wants to speed up development by hiring more people, but the new people need to learn and be trained and that takes time. It is better to hire more people than you need early and fire off the people who suck or are bad at learning then it is to try to frantically hire and train people later on. The fact that the people paying money or hiring don't want to train makes it hard for newcomers with no experience (i.e. \"freshers\") to enter the job market and become junior developers, which is the title people get when they have like 0-2 years of experience (it's basically an on-the-job apprenticeship where your mentor is a senior developer) . Newcomers fresh out of school take more time to learn the ropes than people who have been doing the same job for years (i.e. senior developers). Junior developers need more ramp-up time, and employers don't want to pay for ramp-up time. For this reason, usually the first one or two coding jobs are the hardest for a computer science person to get. After they have the work experience, it's usually a lot easier to get a job but employers give them less ramp-up time then when they were first starting out. So getting your first programming job is a big problem for hobbyists/students and then after that the ramp-up is a big problem. Some people are slow at ramp-up and employers are impatient and they just fire off the slow people. Eventually people who are very slow keep getting fired and end up having to find a different industry. I was very bad at ramp-up and ultimately ended up unemployed and then on government disability benefits. So yeah, I would say the most common problems are getting your first job and the ramp-up. Learning technical stuff like programming languages and frameworks is a problem for some people but me personally, I used to enjoy reading books on that stuff that I bought off of Amazon before bed so that wasn't my main problem. Like if I needed to learn C I would read \"The C Programming Language\" book before bed or if I needed to learn Node.js I would read a book on that before bed and in general that combined with some time Googling and reading documentation on the job was enough. Once you learn a few programming languages, learning a new one isn't a problem and once you learn a few web frameworks like Node.js , Spring Boot, Django, Ruby on Rails, and so forth then learning an additional one isn't a problem. Hobbyists/students have some difficulty learning their first framework but for people with experience learning a new one isn't a problem. As for solutions, I dunno. It's hard to predict how good someone will be at a job before they spend time trying to do the job. There is a minimum barrier to entry but above that it is hard to predict. These problems like teamwork and ramp-up are systemic things and there isn't an easy fix. Like maybe if people were more intelligent or had more talent ramp-up would be easier. Some people have personality disorders like Narcissistic Personality Disorder which make teamwork with them difficult. There isn't an easy fix for these things. **Edit**: Another person replied \"Managers who don't understand what they want, what they need, and what is not possible.\" At Amazon I was blessed with a good, organized manager with technical skills so I didn't have the problem of a manager who didn't know what is not technically possible, but if your manager can't read or write code and has never built a code project himself then you can run into this issue.",
        "Mostly, these are non-technical. It's not the language, or the hardware, but the people wanting the code. People want things that work the way they imagine, and faster than can be built. As an analogy, they want you to build a skyscraper, in a week, for $50, but it's absolutely safe and will last 100 years. It's mostly because programming is a \"silent\" craft -- you can't see the steps being performed until it's completely done, so you have no way to judge the actual work.",
        "Not enough information - insist on \"product owners\" and/or \"business analysts\" on producing proper detailed requirements. This is not directly software development it's requirements elicitation and analysis. Without know exactly to the n'th detail what you want us to produce, we can't produce what you want. Not enough time. \"Done\" is a very, very broad term. Too often management see software as a physical labour like set of tasks. A task can be \"done\" or \"not done\". If you allow business to drive the cadence and the definition of done, the first thing engineers will throw out when time comes up short is ... quality. It may appear \"done\" on the Jira board, but the fact it has hard-coded config, no logging, no unit tests and no documentation doesn't register outside of the dev team who now in addition to what comes next they also have to support this \"liability\" and stand zero chance of getting time to correct it, until it has a high profile blowup. Not enough of the right people. We currently suffer from the software industry expanding many times over in numbers. However the number of actual \"computer science degree\" holders is falling rapid as well. This is putting a LOT of strain on the industry and a large amount of code being written is being written in a \"University\" style. Barely working, tutorial style code with covers the happy path and to hell with the errors. Not enough access/permissions/rights. Particularly in the financial industry, not have access to, having to wait weeks for access, having to approve every step with other teams, extended dependancy chains and incredibly slow decision chains.... all add up to a software delivery rate about 1/10th the industry average."

        "One example is that using UML, one can describe the relationship one object has to another. Another example is that a UML diagram (most of the time) contains clear formulation of data types. Databases are often designed before they are actually developed. Having \u2018a clear blueprint\u2019 of the database that has to be built & especially one that has been refined and reviewed is often welcomed by developers / software engineers.",
        "We use UML all the time at work when designing solutions, but they're almost never class diagrams. Most people dismiss UML as being useless because they associate UML = class diagram, but it is very far from the truth. UML is super important when you're working in a team, to align on a process that you wanna develop, or to present a design to your team. I always have high-level component diagrams which show how the different artifacts (frontend, backend, other processes like AWS Lambda functions, DB, etc.) will be deployed and will interact at a high level. I also often have activity diagrams to show a flow at a high-level, and sequence diagrams to dive more in depth. The goal is that any reader can have an overview of how the system will be before they start reading the description which is a lot denser. On personal projects I will often do a very basic class diagram just to organize the tables I will need but without having to create them before I'm sure of the final structure.",
        "I sort of make a uml in my head, at most I'll scribble them down on paper, I don't use apps to make them.  They're a great way to highlight problems, inadequacies, redundancies between many subsystems early on before you write the first line of code. It helps clear the fog a bit and give you a pretty reasonable if fuzzy idea on what systems and components you need to make and how they need to talk to one another."

        "I love tabs but find that more than 5 open is more trouble than it\u2019s worth. I like IDEAs setting to show them as a single row. I think they could be improved but have no big ideas. Perhaps have a fixed set of tabs with a popup over the tab name enabling me to switch file contents by selecting the file name. I love split windows and use them often in (guess what - tabs) :). I did them great for writing a new function when I also need to reference another in the file. I primarily rarely do this and only need one. Other ideas I would love to be able to control+click and have my editor show a list of functions in the file and allow me to pop over to the chosen one. My editor does a version of this but it\u2019s far more clunky. The idea being that I want to be able to quickly move around without scrolling or searching. CodeWarrior editor did this back in the day. Multi window use has gone bar-shit crazy. Every editor crams my entire workspace with stuff I mostly don\u2019t need. I long for a cleaner interface that is simple and has less panels all over but has been elegantly designed for what it does do. My current favorite editor allows me to zoom the editor window to use the full space which is an OK compromise, but I often find myself struggling with panels as my monitor is only 27\u201d which is as big as I\u2019m willing to go.",
        "I love tabs, but few programs handle things well when there are many open at once. Chrome will squish them together to be unusable. Firefox will keep the tabs at a usable size, but make you click to scroll them, making that unusable. Best thing I've seen so far is an option to grow the tab bar downwards when enough tabs are open. Options to sort or group tabs would be helpful too.",
        "I would say tabs are fine. I don't really like or dislike them. They're a reasonable presentation of \"what files am I working with at the moment\". Tree style tabs (see: the Firefox browser extension) could possibly be interesting, but it would require more screen real estate that I don't think I'd want to give up. I'd probably be fine with something like a keyboard shortcut that opened a panel with the N most recent files opened. I use split windows pretty heavily to have code and the tests for that code open side by side. I think I've occasionally pulled out a third panel to reference another file related to what I was working on but that's a very rare use case.",
        "I use VSCode all day and I had to reopen it as I couldn't remember if it used tabs. I guess I have tab blindness. I think of my VSCode as commandP and the left Explorer tree. If you want some weird editors, take a look at some of the Smalltalk IDEs especially in the 90s. Generally one function at a time. I did a lot of work in IBM VisualAge Smalltalk where I'd have literally dozens windows (maybe even close to 100 open on Windows NT). VisualAge for Java was similar but was supplanted by Eclipse. The Humane Assessment tools are also interesting:",
        "I use tabs extensively, but It would be nice if someone came up with something better. Tabs are great when their number is reasonably small (5-8 per split pane), but they get hard to read if you have to scroll the tab bar. I do use split panes, I typically have between 6 and 8 panes open per monitor across two monitors, with a few tabs in each pane. If I had higher resolution monitors, or more monitors, I would use more panes so that my tabs didn't stack as much. I would use some kind of a centralized tab switcher that listed files alphabetically no matter what pane they were in, provided it was compact enough.",

It's pretty much all I use to open files. If I have more than 4 or 5 tabs I end up closing the ones I'm not working on. Is it really that bad? I don't think you're going to improve on the basic idea of a file browser, so I like the navigation pane. I never need full width of my IDE just to edit code. Maybe I'm in the minority there.",
        "1) Yes. Either this or you get multiple windows of the same application. Though working on one file at a time and always having to close and reopen files is possible, it would kill my productivity. 2/3) I actually hate this design as I'm kind of a tab hoarder with often 10 or more tabs opened. I'd love at least a multi-row display of tabs or the possibility to vertically display them, like a project explorer. Maybe even grouping - based on various attributes for example. Like package, Task associated, custom grouping, or even more complex stuff. For example automatically grouped by the underlying object: in most Frameworks you get controller, dto/model, service and repository that mostly follow a the same meaning convention. XyzController, XyzDto, Xyz, XyzService, XyzRepository. 4)  yes. Mostly if I need to do sth in one file that depends on the structure of another.

There are special tools that can let someone of sufficient skill break down computer code and look at it instruction by instruction, just like you could use advanced laboratory tools like a microscope and chromatograph to eventually derive the recipe for a cake.

Game code is very difficult (but not impossible) for humans to read and understand. How they do it is leaning on experience, the few facts they do know, making assumptions, and a lot of trial and error. The format of a Windows exe file is well-known. It's safe to assume that it contains Assembly code for Intel-compatible CPUs. It's safe to assume it was written in C++ because that's the games industry standard, and it's highly probable that it was compiled with gcc (GNU C Compiler) because it's the most widely used compiler. From that little knowledge you can start to pick apart the puzzle, which is what gdb/deassembler and friends are doing to turn it back into something human-readable. Worst case scenario, none of that works. They can still open up the exe as a binary file, as well as inspect what's going on in their RAM as the game runs, change the 1s and 0s and see what happens.

      "output": [
        "Gordon Moore originally said that transistor density would double every year, and then revised it to every two years. This has held true from about 1970 to today. However, it has never been clear that it would continue to hold true. When we say today that Moore's Law will fail unless new technologies like 3D chip technology succeed, this isn't really different from any other era - there have _always_ been limits blocking the path of Moore's Law, that have _always_ required innovative new technologies to advance beyond. However, there has been one major sea change, that happened roughly around 2005. From 1970 to 2005, transistor density increases were generally coupled with clock speed increases, enabled by shorter and/or narrower interconnect lines. So before 2005 it was common to misquote Moore as having said that clock speeds would double every two years. Post-2005, clock speeds have mostly stayed the same, and the increased transistor counts have been used to pack more \"stuff\" - multiple CPU cores, more cache RAM, on-chip GPUs and peripheral interconnects, etc - onto single chips. So in terms of what's next, either Moore's Law will fail and the rate of generational improvement in microprocessors will slow down, or else we can expect more and more on-chip features and functions. How about a single chip with twenty 200BOps/sec CPU cores, 128GB RAM, two 4090-class GPU cores and 64 PCIe lanes, allowing phones with multiples of the performance of current desktop computers. So the question is, what will we do with all this power? Most people aren't running into CPU or GPU limitations on their phones, and would rather for phones to get cheaper rather than more powerful. This isn't the first time we've said this, and in the past we've always found new applications that give people reasons to want all this power. If you can have eight or twelve 4090s in your pocket, do they just go 99.9% unused all day? Or does this enable some new world where, I don't know, deep learning networks are constantly training themselves on your daily movements and activities and conversations, allowing Star Trek style digital assistants? (\"Hey Siri, did Bob sound insincere to you just then?\") So, yes, it is a messy and confusing area, because it's not just some physical law to be followed. It's really a bit self-fulfilling - each chip maker thinks their competitors are going to be roughly where Moore's Law predicts, so they invest in R&D to hit that target. Hope this explanation helped rather than just made it more confusing.",
        "To tack on to what others have said, it's worth noting that defining \"density\" is slightly subjective. In my view, Moore's law was never really about the physics so much as it was about tooling and business projection. Businesses like \"predictable scaling\" or \"predictable progress\" because it means they have a pipeline of future innovations to bank on. This is extremely rare and Moore's law may have been a lucky guess, or extremely insightful, depending on your point-of-view. The bigger idea of computational scaling through physical enhancements is dead and has been dead for over a decade. While today's chips are smaller, faster and cheaper than chips from 10 years ago, they have not maintained anything like a geometric rate of computational scaling through physical enhancements. As you scale down, there are many new confounding variables that were not important at larger scales. Some major new factors that can be mentioned include leakage power and dynamic capacitance. Obviously, those factors were present before, but they were relatively negligible. Today, managing leakage power is such a big problem on state-of-the-art processing cores that there is dedicated circuitry and a dedicated on-chip embedded processor whose sole task is to minimize leakage power. This processor is like those motion-activated hallway lights in big office buildings -- it monitors what portions of the chip are in active use and powers down any large unused blocks. Whenever a block is due to be used again (even speculatively), it will power it back up in anticipation of its use. If you go back to a Pentium Pro-era CPU, there was nothing like this. This shift (among many others) shows that, as you scale down, the number and complexity of control problems increases, of in non-linear ways. It is remarkable that, despite these hurdles to scaling, processing cores have continued to advance in performance against wall-clock benchmarks like Cinebench, and at a geometric rate. How is that possible? Well, it turns out that physical enhancements are only one part of the performance formula, the other part is *architecture*. Architecture improvements bring an absolute performance improvement *even on the same physical substrate*. The silicon industry has been making improvements on both fronts simultaneously, and that's the \"untold story\" of processing core advancement. \"We built a better prefetcher and we weakened the load/store ordering rules, which can be leveraged by a compatible compiler\" is not as attention-getting as \"we invented a tinier transistor!\"",
        "Moore himself said there will be a point where we will be bound by physical limitations. It would be kind of nonsensical that the Moore's law could just continue infinitely. I'm not sure we hit that point yet, but we are approaching it. Next big step are quantum computers. But i don't really know anything about those, so can't really give any insight on that."

The former I believe will be mostly a shift in need for investing in good data infrastructure. That latter I think is plausibly a new kind of hybrid QA/DS role in the short to medium term, because it really is a lot different than validating any other kind of software in the past. It's kind of a hybrid of how ML models, software, and products are validated, all wrapped up in one much messier problem which is often data scarce in a way model validation never is. To date, no one really does the latter basically at all though. The main frameworks barely even acknowledge that measuring whether and how well your thing works is even a thing you should aspire to do. But yeah, of course at some point the latter will be able to be automated. Just in the short to medium term there's a messy problem there that is significantly novel relative to existing job descriptions. With respect to the former it will eventually be automated, but the senior/staff level architecture/system design part will be there for at least a while. Someone needs to understand the whole thing end to end to be able to curate the ecosystem properly. Very few staff/principal engineers can even do that job well, and there's basically no training data for a model to learn from (that skill isn't even taught in schools at all), so going to take quite a while before an engineering org can just take their hands off the wheel completely. Prompt engineering as it exists today is, of course, not going to be a job in the medium to long term. These models are really great at writing copy for freeform text. That is what they do, they already are pretty good at reviewing and modifying prompts, and could be easily fine tuned for that task. We could even have that task automated by fitting against the validation framework as the loss in RL finetuning. And that's already such a miniscule percentage of the work bringing an AI system to prod that the engineer or DS/QA person can do it to the degree that there is any meaningful amount of work to do at all. When bringing one of these things to prod we've never spent more than a few hours on the prompt itself. The RAG layer that injects context, sure. The prompt?

Frameworks are useful in a similar way to libraries, in that they give you certain common functionality built-in so you don't have to code everything from scratch.

        "Having an intermediate language also lets you separate the frontendy language concerns from the backendy architecture concerns. You can write a really badass optimizing compiler from JVM to your architecture of choice, and then someone else can write a new language targeting the JVM (say, Scala) and get all the advantages of your optimized backend for free. And all the other development tooling built around the intermediate language. That's not something specific about interpreted languages either, LLVM does the same thing for C/C++.",
        "1, JIT optimizations based on instructions available and runtime analisys. 2, ARM for desktop and server is on the up and up. 3, Most compilers are two-stage anyway, a \"front-end\" compiling to an IL, and a \"back-end\" compiling the IL for a specific architecture. Not that much of a stretch to distribute the IL/bytecode. 4, Look at the lengths JS developers go to minify/uglify/obfuscate their \"source only\" distributions. Not everything is open source. 5, Platform-specific binaries are a hassle when trying to distribute libraries via code repositories.",
        "Also, there are all sorts of bugs and exploits possible when compiling to native code that don't work when targeting a runtime environment. So it's less risky in general. In my job, we use a lot of hand-tuned assembly for the compute-heavy SIMD-friendly core algorithms that really benefit from it, and Java for the the low-compute workflow stuff. Writing that in C compiling to native code wouldn't help anything, but would raise risk and thus testing requirements. And migrating from x86-64 to Graviton is much easier when most of the code is portable, and only the compute-intensive core needs to get ported. Well, really reimplemented; SIMD doesn't translate directly between architectures.",
        "I see you've never had to deal with 32 bit / 64 bit native code compatibility. When pointers are different sizes then your data structures are different sizes, and that's why it's hard to get precompiled 32-bit dependencies to work in a 64-bit process. It's why a lot of C or C++ projects choose to recompile all their third-party dependencies. With Java, you don't need to worry about it. The same JAR from 25 years ago will load into a 64-bit JVM today without any issues. Another interesting design choice is that Javac is relatively \"dumb\". It performs some optimizations, but it relies on the JVM to perform more. As a result, you can get performance improvements simply by upgrading your JVM. You also don't need to worry about x86 vs. ARM, which is fairly important these days. I think you could instead call Java \"compile once / run everywhere\". Java's bytecode format makes reflection pretty easy. The CLASS file format records information like the methods and fields that exist on a class. While you can certainly have reflection even in a language that compiles to native code, those languages tend to be cagey about doing that. At my previous job, we used [Bytebuddy] to do some runtime code generation. That is to say, we didn't write a Java source file to disk and then invoke the compiler; rather, we used ByteBuddy to generate bytecode directly and completely in-memory. That's harder, but not impossible to do with native code. For example, LLVM defines a sort of bytecode that you can JIT compile to native code. But really, people use Java because of the Java ecosystem. The JVM is quite good, the set of third-party libraries is comprehensive, and everything is very mature. Are there bugs and security issues? Sure. And if you *really* want to compile to native, GraalVM exists.",
        "The thread so far seems focused on application development - i.e., when the developer (at least sometimes) knows what architectures the app needs to run on and can compile for those architectures. But don't forget that a _huge_ portion of especially the Java ecosystem is _libraries_, not applications. If JARs were architecture-specific you'd have to compile and distribute one JAR variant for each architecture where anyone might possibly want to use your library - present, future or even past. You already get dependency hell issues some of the time, imagine how much worse that would be when your build fails because a fourth-order transitive dependency for parsing URL parameter strings that's finished long ago with latest release in 2006 didn't see into the future and compile a JAR for Apple M1 decades before the architecture launched. Or conversely, maybe the ARM architecture existed at the time but wasn't popular enough for that developer to bother compiling for it, so now you're stil stuck if you want to run your app on ARM, unless you can get hold of the source code and compile it yourself. And even then - if you've ever had to deal with binary Python package distributions (\"wheels\"), you've probably had a taste of the hassle that can bring when you need to recompile a wheel and the compilation fails for some reason. Some language communities solve this by distributing source code instead of compiled code, and having the endpoint application developer compile all of the dependencies along with the application itself. And that works, of course, assuming compilers and build tools are robust enough to work reliably across the rainbow of possible OS environments and don't crash because you have a wrong environment variable set or the wrong version of libc or the compiler, etc... But with original source code these are at least problems that _can_ be solved; you'll have no such luck with machine code distributions.",
        "Actually, with .NET in Azure, you do use them unchanged from platform to platform. You don't have to recompile them. You also have a vast library of packages that you can just import into your application and run in a Linux VM and it will just... work. A lot of companies will develop with Windows (because Visual Studio) and use Linux VMs in the cloud to run .NET web apps because of slightly better performance and because they are much cheaper. I've also written command line stuff that, while the bootstrapper executable would be different per OS , the libraries are the same.",
        "Focusing on why use a VM runtime instead of native binaries. You are wrong that Java never took off on the Desktop. It absolutely did,.it was a go-to option for most desktop software that didn't need the power of C++. Sure, more server stuff exists, and these days Python Qt/Gtk and Electron fill that cross platform niche instead. And desktop is unpopular these days compared to web apps. But it was once extremely popular. Also, you do not always know what architecture or OS you are writing for. Even if you are writing an internal proprietary server you may know the machine you will run it on for the next 5 years, but not in 15 or 30 years. If you make any OS or machine specific choices, it becomes harder to switch to new platforms as you now have to rewrite and debug your source again for something that used to work. Java guarantees long term compatibility, as you can always port a JVM to your needed platform. As a side effect, with JVM and such, only the JVM itself needs to be debugged for new platforms and ensure compatibility with the standard. All programs in it can then run with backwards compatibility. It shares the effort across all users, rather than require each dev team to independently do this work. Lastly, when Java was created, things were a lot less uniform than today. People were using all sorts of architectures and OSes. Anyone writing a library or distributed program with a small team couldn't possibly ensure compatibility with everything. So it is also partly a historical feature, but still does have utility today.",
        "I think with native AOT in .NET, things are coming full circle and with IL as the intermediate between the code and native, it kind of makes sense. In my mind it should make it simpler to create native binaries across multiple platforms if the same intermediate representation can be transformed instead of having to recreate the entire tool chain. As someone who uses VB and .NET, the #1 feature I'm interested in is this... don't give a rats-rearend about \"new language features\"... give me a native compiler... even better... a native cross-compiler. And because it creates the same IL, only need to worry about the native compiler at this level... the language that produced said IL doesn't matter. I'm more than happy to write a tiny bit more code (long-hand) if I can compile native... kind of feels like the whole VB4 to VB5 transition... all over again. Strange how things repeat themselves. ;-)",
        "The real key is that the environment is controlled which means that things like garbage collection and dynamic typing are MUCH easier to provide to programmers. When something on the heap loses all its references, the runtime that interprets the bytecode for the computer can see that and at an opportune time run garbage collection on that piece of memory. There's also interoperability between programming languages. If you're a C++ programmer you don't have to learn C#, just Microsoft's language extensions for C++/CLI that allow you to write code that happily interoperates with the C# code and can even be compiled into the same binary. And also Powershell basically is a command shell for the .NET runtime. You can basically operate with any .NET type you want from powershell scripts or even the command line; including Winforms and WPF. So there are other benefits.",
        "I think there are a lot of examples to show that making binaries IL to work on different architectures is not a big deal, the deal is to properly adopt standard APIs for the environment the program is running in, otherwise there'll be very limited functionality. That's why things like Electron gathered much adoption, you can make more things than browser does and it is cross-platform. That's the point I believe. These days there is a portable C standard library with compiler which is capable of targeting almost any x86/ARM host via a single binary, still not very popular: Guess if they manage to extend API surface and implement dynamic library loading, things may change, but now this is the tool for specific use-cases, due to limitations it has.",
        "Better optimization. I'm not sure that this is an actual reason, but it's certainly a possible benefit. The JVM, for example, may first translate bytecode to adequate fast machine code. But over time it can gather runtime metrics and optimize \"hotspots\". It can further use runtime information to do optimizations that aren't possible to do with a static compiler at compilation time (or link time). C language maintainers realized this benefit and now support limited [profile-guided optimization]. However, it's contrived data from running tests and not as good as actual production execution. However, due to many other factors, overall Java is not faster than C, but, in theory, a C that targeted bytecode could beat C that emitted native code, if it used this method of continual runtime optimization.",
        "A lot of Java is historical and did not make sense within 2 or 3 years, much less after all this time. Nonetheless, if you take the whole package, Java is a really practical backend server language. Fwiw, here's what I say about the bytecodes, if we could start over today and not worry about sunk costs. Having some form IR at all is valuable for a couple of things: mixing different languages together, and separating effort between the front-end and backed of the compiler. Any language and runtime of this maturity and complexity is sure to have an IR, and probably multiple layers of different IRs. Also, in Java, it is nice that a library maintainer can publish a single jar and doesn't need to recompile it many times for different consumers. I believe Rust had a module format that works similar to that. You really want this for any language where people link each others code together, because otherwise your options are source code and or recompiling a bunch of times. This format is the same in Java as one of the compiler IRs, but it doesn't have to be. However, I would agree that it has not gone well to use jars as a format for deploying applications, but rather that by heroic efforts it is nowadays. In my experience lately, you deploy those bytecodes along with a copy of the specific JVM implementation that you run those bytecodes, so the exercise is really silly. You're still shipping a machine specific binary. Except for historical reasons, it would make much more sense as you say to do more of the compilation ahead of time. It's all very roundabout. It requires the JVM to do a lot of the work on the fly that would normally be done at compile time. This makes startup slow. It makes benchmarking difficult and awkward since you have to decide how much warmup to allow before benchmarking. It means a lot of memory gets eaten up by the JIT cache. It does mean that the optimizer can use dynamic data. The optimizer can speculatively inline and then undo it and recompile if it turns out that it speculated wrong. I'm not sure how big a deal this is in practice, though. In practice, people tune their hotspots and then just let 99% of the code run dog slow, anyway."

        "You'd need a rigorous definition of what counts as \"mechanical.\" Can it have electronics of any kind? Optics? Vacuum tubes? Transistors? If it can only be clockwork, then I don't think you can build a computer complex enough to play chess without it being \"massive and expensive.\" Consider that a 1kHz clock is 60,000 RPM, so clockwork this fast would require exotic materials and lubricants. With reasonably priced clockwork, we can expect maybe a tenth of that, 100Hz. Assuming we can build an 8-bit CPU and ~ 32kB RAM out of clockwork, then we could run something like Turbo Chess (from Turbo Pascal), roughly ten times slower than it would have run on an early 80s CP/M machine. An 8080 CPU has about 6000 transistors, so even assuming we can find some very optimal way to implement the RAM (one 256-position gear per byte, or something), that's still _at least_ around 40,000 clockwork components. I believe this is around 10X more components than the most complex clockwork devices ever actually built, though I didn't do much research into this. So let's assume this could be built, and that it runs correctly at 6000 RPM. If we then held it to tournament time controls, it _might_ just barely be capable of making legal moves (including not moving into check). In terms of quality of play, we should expect it to be beaten by any halfway competent six-year-old. Edit: Early 80s CP/M machines ran at around 1MHz, not 1kHz. So all this is off by a factor of 1000, and I am changing my answer to: no machine made of macroscopic clockwork could ever possibly play even very bad chess at tournament speed. We're talking more like hours per move.",
        "u/ghjm has given a great answer. I want to extend his answer a bit in terms of brainstorming how it might be possible to build an effective mechanical chess engine. Note that most mechanical computers have been based on gears (gear-ratios, etc.) which may or may not be the most efficient way to implement a chess-computer mechanically. Consider [bit-boards]. It is not difficult to imagine mechanical bit-boards implemented as metal masks with physical holes drilled through. By pressing spring-loaded pins onto a bit-board, it would be possible to test all 64-squares in parallel against that bit-board. We could stack such masks together to answer questions like \"can the rook on a2 be captured by the bishop on b3?\" Position the respective masks over each other, press pins onto the mask and check if any pins pass through the other side (for example, use a bar to check if there is an obstruction from any pin). To increase performance somewhat, you could implement, say, 100 such mechanisms operating in parallel. This would allow the mechanical computer to check 100 bitboard positions, in parallel. Such an operation would complete in one step the equivalent of hundreds or thousands of instructions in a CPU. Of course, a CPU is still operating thousands or millions of times faster, so the advantage of mechanical parallelism would still not be sufficient to make the mechanical computer on par with a CPU, or anywhere near it. But I think it may be possible to not only implement a chess engine that can make legal moves, but also make reasonable novice moves. I think you'd still want to use some electro-mechanical components to help with the I/O or you'd drive yourself bonkers waiting for a long time for the mechanical system to do these very basic tasks. But, if you had enough time, patience, money and skill to implement it all mechanically, I see no reason you couldn't build such a machine. Assuming 100 parallel bit-board testers, and a testing frequency of say, 10 Hz (something like sewing-machine speed), that would give you 1000 parallel bitboard tests per second. Given that the masking is done in parallel (all masks tested simultaneously, let's say 20 masks per test), that would be equivalent to about 20,000 bitboards per second, and remember that each bitboard may require multiple cycles for the CPU to process. Still massively slower than a CPU, but still fast enough to actually do some novice-style \"if he goes there, then I go here\" calculations.",
        "The only semi reasonable ish way this could be done, is if you \"program\" it to have ***one strategy***. A very simple one. Such as scholar's mate. Allow a few variations from the opponent to be responded to. But otherwise, the program will just give up and spew random moves until it fails. Such a program could win against say a newbie 5yo, or anybody else of similar-ish skill level. This is basically how I can win at blindfolded chess. I'll rush towards a very quick checkmate (even if it is risky, and means poor long term development for me), as I know if the game drags to be a forty move plus game, I'll simply not be able to handle the extra mental load of it."

        "This explaination is going to be pretty simplified and won't be exactly true to how it works for , for example x86 or other commonly used assembly languages. There are several layers of languages. The most basic levels are what the CPU can understand. The lowest level is microcode, followed by machine code and assembly. A CPU works by having several components, such as registers which hold a single number and operators which use the data stored in those registers to calculate something. All of these signals might be connected to the same \"bus\" or set of wires which together represent a single number. The CPU has a section which will generate the signals to control these sections so that only one section may output to the bus at a time. This takes a \"microcode\" as input and outputs a signal to each section. For example, there may be microcode to turn on the output of the adder to the bus and for a register to save the value on the bus. Microcode signals are in binary. The next level is the actual machine code, which is the first point at which you could write any code without making your own hardware. A part of the CPU will take a machine code signal as input, and then step through several microcode steps in order to perform some actions. For example, there may be a command to load a number into a register from RAM, which will involve putting the address (where in RAM the relevant number is) into the RAM Address register, which will cause the output of the RAM module to be the appropriate value, then move the value from RAM to the target register. These machine codes are still in binary. For an 8-bit machine code, it might be for example 00100110. Then there is Assembly. Assembly is human readable (kinda...) code. It is a slight abstraction from the machine code. As a simplification, you can consider that a single assembly instruction might be the same as one or a few machine code instructions, but are relatively close. Assembly is often written in some letters. For example, a simple code to move a number between two registers might be `MOV A, B` to copy a number from the A to the B register A compiler is a program which will convert a code to the appropriate machine code. Given a simple assembly language where each adsembly instruction is the same as a single machine code instruction, and starting with some code written in that assembly, a compiler will go through each instruction and swap it for the appropriate machine code. Given the copy example from before it might end up producing the result `00001011` as the result, which is the machine code which will tell the CPU to step through the microcode which will output the A register value to the bus and simultaneously make the B register store the value from the bus. In \"higher level\" languages like C or C++, the same kind of thing happens, however there's more of an abstraction from the assembly. Whereas in assembly you might write ` LD 0x5, A STR A, 0x1 To set the value of A to be 5 then store it in RAM, languages like C or C++ it is easier to write as `x=5`. In most cases, they abstract away the concept of registers, and operations can be performed more simply. It also takes away the hassle of needing to know which registers are necessary for which operations (as some operations are only able to be performed using some registers) or needing to know exactly where in RAM variables are.  You cam more simply move data around and perform operations on them. Compared to a lot of more recent languages, languages like C++/C are considered low level. This is because they have a lot of smaller necessities such as considering pointers (storing the value of dynamically created objects), manual garbage collection (getting rid of objects not necessary anymore) and the platform (what kind of CPU it's running on). Higher level languages provide even more abstractions from this, which makes the barrier to entry lower, and you have to take less things into constant consideration (though they shouldn't be completely ignored). They also provide some features such as automatic garbage collection, and JIT compilation, where the code instead of being compiled directly to machine code is compiled to a intermediate language similar to assembly, and then on runtime a JIT compiler will compile the program for the particular CPU / instruction set. The latter feature makes portability easier. Higher level languages aren't inherently better than languages like C/C++, just suited for different tasks. A language like C/C++ will be faster and more optimized in some instances, while language like C#, Java, or Python will have the benefit of a lower barrier to entry, easier collaboration, and more portability. A language like python is what is known as an interpreted language. This means that instead of being compiled directly to some other language, there is a second program known as an interpreter which will run the code. The difference is that interpretation happens on runtime and will often be slower than a compiled language. The python interpreter is written in C++ I believe. Python also has the option to be compiled, if you can get a python compiler. This can take the form of being compiled to another language like C++ or directly to machine code."

        "If it's really RGB data, and it's uncompressed (meaning it's actually 8 bits per channel--24 bits per pixel), and we don't need an alpha channel (which would be 8 bits and would make the pixel 32 bits), we really do just store it unaligned. There's no wastage, but accessing the data is slightly less efficient in some circumstances. It's worth mentioning that every 4 pixels is aligned again on a 32-bit boundary."

        "You can run a web server on a matchbox sized computer. Implementing the most simple web server is super easy, like under a 100 lines of code easy. It would work something like this: * Opens a TCP/IP port for listening (port 80). * When another computer on the internet/network sends a request to this port, * it reads a file from disk (say, index.html), * and writes the contents of this file back on the port. That's it, that's a minimal web server that serves static files. You can read about this in detail in the book High Performance Browser Networking by Grigorik. Now, sometimes, say, when you login to hotmail, the web server can't just serve you a file off of its hard drive and needs to generate a page, for example, in this case it needs to generate a page listing all of your emails using the help of a database system such as PostgreSQL. In this case, the web server (say, Apache), instead of reading and spitting the webpage from disk, will go and read a PHP file, and then execute it using an Apache module (called something like mod\\_php). This module knows how to read and execute PHP files, so it will read and execute the PHP file which is basically just an HTML webpage. But a PHP file also has special code segments written between the html, and these code sections are executed when the php file is run. In these code sections is code that will call the database and get a list of your e-mail, for example, and code to put pretty html around each email. Dynamic web pages have seen lots of technologies come and go including PHP. These would include CGI + perl/C, many flavors of ASP, JSP, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Elixir, etc. Lots of other technologies are now also involved that make things more efficient. Stuff like Servlets, memcached (tool for caching data from a database), cloud functions, Full stack Javascript with a dumber database (see MEAN/MERN stack), Elixir VM, etc. Almost every dynamic webpage language/stack has its own special way of scaling for more users. PHP is like the Toyota Corolla of this market. Very widely used, can cover the use case for most people, and extremely popular because of Wordpress which is written in PHP. In its heyday, PHP ran with Apache and MySQL as the most popular way of making any kind of dynamic website such as social networking. Lots of -AMP stacks such as WAMP, LAMP, etc became popular. Facebook is still mostly a php shop. Knowing PHP is easy and rewarding for when you do have to fix someone's Wordpress or otherwise make a simple change to a simple web app. But there's more advanced stuff out there, and PHP somewhat lost the race when it comes to scaling to a higher number of users. It can be done, but it comes with more pain points. Hence, PHP-only programmers don't get a lot of respect on the streets.",
        "At the level of detail you're talking about, a web server is pretty simple. It's only when you drill down into the details that it gets complex. A whole history of web protocols and servers from 1993 to 2023 is beyond the scope of a reddit comment. There have been many fashions and styles of web server in this time. The sources of complexity often include authentication/authorization, encryption, integrating disparate applications (proxying), and integrating language runtimes (perl, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, .NET, node.js, and so on). The key challenge with web server software is often scale. Pretty much anything will work if you only have to deal with 3 users a day. But if your website gets popular and your server starts melting down, details start to matter. For example, suppose you have a Python-based web app, do you launch a new Python runtime for every request, or do you keep a single runtime and make many requests to it? Obviously the latter allows you to serve more requests per unit of computational resources, but it also means that any crashes, bugs or instability in your Python code can affect sessions other than the one they're running on. Web servers like Apache and Nginx are designed to give you a great deal of configuration flexibility so you can run your site in the appropriate way for your requirements. That's what makes them so complex."

But if you\u2019re deciding on a framework that will be written by many engineers and used by millions of people, you need to be more selective with your choices. react has an incredibly large community/following and by proxy much Much MUCH more support/documentation as opposed to any of the framework/libraries/compilers(svelte in essence is a javascript compiler more so than a framework) you suggested. Secondly, there are more engineers who know how to write react than any of those you listed so there will be a shorthand that exists between engineers. And thirdly, you WILL run into issues/limitations with any new framework so as you\u2019re discovering problems, people using other more-established frameworks will have an easier time. Your only recourse with finding issues is either asking the small dev team in charge of the project to fix that issue or you fix it yourself.

So a lot of people wait until there is a critical mass of other developers working with it too so that it will continue to get attention and support before starting in with it.

I was young in my career and hadn't yet experienced long term results/consequences from short-sighted decision making practices.

Do the DD, flesh out the idea to the point of exhaustion. By the end of the discussion you should be able to accurately determine if it is actually a good idea.

You may even be able to make progressive changes: store recent video at high resolution, full color. For older data, re-encode as low-framerate, low-resolution, black-and-white.

        "Based on available information and the basics of computer architecture, we know that mass-surveillance systems do not operate by blindly storing all data in raw form. This is much too bulky. Rather, data is stored in tiers of circular buffers, and longer buffers are more compressed/stripped. Buffer lengths might be 24 hours, 72 hours, 30 days, 90 days, etc. Motion-detection alone would allow you to throw out almost all raw footage due to non-activity in the frame. After that, you would want to process raw frames through a classification neural-net to detect the type of action in the scene, throwing out scenes that you don't care about, such as cats or dogs walking across the frame. More sophisticated classification may sort scenes based on typical versus non-typical activity, e.g. delivery trucks versus passenger vehicles, throwing out typical activity and only keeping non-typical activity. And with the help of transformer-based LLMs or diffusion-based neural nets, it is possible to describe the activity in a scene in plain-text, *semantically*, which enables extremely sophisticated filtering. That 215 petabytes per year can be cut down many orders of magnitude. Ideally, you want to do motion-detection and any other basic processing on-camera to save both bandwidth and storage. But there is no insurmountable logistical obstacle to building and operating mass-surveillance systems at the scale of 700 million cameras or more. London has at least 500,000 cameras that we know about, and there are doubtless many more we do not. China has even more cameras in its urban areas. Ingesting all that data into a central surveillance system is not impossible. [VICE: How China Tracks Everyone]"

AI uses a **lot** of computer power and data, especially training. These calculations would be really slow without modern hardware like GPUs (and now custom processors). The internet has made it possible to build really big collections of data for training. 2. Machine learning (which is really a somewhat separate field than AI) represents a quite different approach to how you write software. Instead of giving the computer instructions on what to do, you give it examples (usually lots and lots) of what you want, and then you program systems that analyze that data to find patterns and \"learn\" how to solve the problem. This allows you to solve problems that humans don't actually know how to solve with algorithms. This includes a lot of things we do unconsciously, like process images and speech. 3. New algorithms have been developed that improve what we can do with this data. This is a more complicated story - some of these algorithms (e.g. stochastic gradient descent, neural neta) aren't really that new, but people have figured out various tricks that let them work better (batch norm, resnets, Adam optimizer, transformers, and lots of other things).

Some languages are defined to be executed by the \"translator\" (interpreter is a more correct word), some are designed to be \"translated\" once to machine code once and then can run without any help (it's more complicated than that but don't worry about it). There's also languages that mix the two. For instance, Java is translated into machine code but the machine itself is actually virtual and runs on top of thr other machine. Also some languages are \"translated\" to other high level languages: CoffeeScript is translated to JavaScript, for instance. Basically, you can build chains of that, it's a mess. Ultimately, it depends what is the executor of your program. In Python the executor is the python interpreter. In C the executor is the CPU itself. 2. OSes provide lots of functionality on top of the CPU. For example, writing to a file or displaying hello world. For example, writing to a file in Linux is different from writing to a file in Windows. If my machine code tries to call a \"function\" from Windows, it won't work on Linux (upd. re: your last paragraph, you're right. However, there's some other stuff like metadata etc. Different OSes load programs into the memory differently) 3. This is a bit tricky. But it depends. Java isn't *really* write once and run everywhere but let's go with this example. The idea is to create a set of programs (JVM in this case) for each system (OS and CPU) that can understand the same language (java machine code) and then they'll be able to run your code \"everywhere\". It's not an easy task. Not to mention, it may be impractical",
        "1. When you install a programming language you are installing two main things: a compiler or interpreter (the \"translator\" program), and a set of pre-translated code you can make use of to avoid rewriting the same things over again (libraries). Without these, a programming language is just a text file you can't do anything with. To run a Python program, you need both as it is interpreted as you run it, and thus only able to run with the interpreter and all libraries present. With C, you still do need to install libraries to run any C program unless the libraries are bundled with the application you are running. But because it is so common of a language, the essential ones tend to come preinstalled on most operating systems as the OS itself uses them. You don't need the compiler because the program is shared in a format that has already been converted to CPU instructions and that your OS can use directly. . 2. You can run programs directly on a CPU with no OS (your operating system does). But most programs rely on the OS for functionality and to manage them. They will execute raw CPU instructions for the core code, but certain tasks like asking for access to more RAM or interfacing with hardware will be handled by the operating system. Each operating system has its own way of allowing programs to interface with it, so the program needs to be compiled for that OS. In addition, operating systems tend to come bundled with their own set of selected libraries, again to simplify common shared tasks like creating a window or sending data over the internet. . 3. Java can only do this because it doesn't compile for the CPU of your machine. It defines a theoretical CPU that it compiles for (the virtual machine), and when you run a Java program your computer uses what is basically an emulator to simulate that theoretical machine. This allows for portability, but comes at a cost of decreased speed and a harder ability for multiple programs written in different languages to interoperate if they don't agree to use the same virtual machine.",
        "You\u2019ve got some definitions wrong there. Python is interpreted. Java and C are \u201chigh level\u201d (I hate that moniker) because it\u2019s not directly doing asm (assembly); though this is possible. All programs are compiled into machine code either at the time when needed or in advance. Interpreted programs (Perl, Python, PHP, Bash, etc) are compiled when they run by the interpreter - hence you run \u201cpython3 myprog.py\u201d; or prefix for script with the interpreter to run it with a hash bang. The benefit is you can write an interpreted program on an intel machine and it work on an arm machine - so long as the other machine has the interpreter installed. Compiled programs do not need an interpreter for the system it runs on. You compile a c/c++/golang project for arm, and it\u2019ll only work on an arm machine. (Ditto for intel).",
        "Basically all a computer can do is assign binary slots or 0 and 1. Someone assigned it 0 and 1 tasks in really hard to write code called assembly. All code is a translation to use assembly. So you are talking to the computer itself, the processor and bypassing the operating system",
        "For 1, you need to install any language that was not already there. Every language needs to be installed at some point. The reason you needed to install Python and not c is that python was not there and c was. The reverse is sometimes true - particularly on Windows (where C is bundled with Visual Studio). The only language you can run without installing anything is binary machine language, but even this may depend on libraries that needed to be installed. This is different from assembler (which is a textual representation of machine language)."

        "Are you writing a new language? There are lots of limiting factors for a new language that make it undesirable to use: - few stable libraries, or compatibility with other languages. - low stability in the language itself - poor documentation or standardization - poorly optimized compilers/interpreters Library availability cannot be fixed in isolation except by chance (getting enough users to make libraries). But it can be made easier. For a compiled language, the ability to use the C ABI and link to/be linked from C code will greatly help. Then any C library could be wrapped to link to your language, and your language can be used to extend C code (or any other language with the ability to call C, like Python/Rust/Go/etc). For interpreted languages, creating a C library to run the interpreter embedded in a C application (like CPython or Lua do) will be helpful. For language stability and standardization, you want to either guarantee backwards compatibility or give a promised roadmap for when stability will be reached. You also want to guarantee you are doing appropriate testing of features. Documentation should be complete and easy to navigate, with in depth descriptions and examples. If your compiler or interpreter is poorly performing compared to other languages, this is a question of optimization. For compiled languages, things like LLVM can help by handling the backend of the compilation process. For interpreters, you need a fast compiler frontend and well designed bytecode with a well optimized VM. Tooling like LSPs, debuggers, build systems, formatters, etc also are helpful for serious adoption."

      "output": [
        "This sort of theory is important because it helps you be a better programmer. You might not very often need to code a data structure, but rather use one supplied by a library or the language itself. But if you know how the data structure is implemented, and its properties in terms of time and space complexity, you can make better choices that lead to a more efficient program. Sometimes it doesn't matter because no matter how you code it the program might be efficient enough for normal inputs. But sometimes it does, especially if you're trying to scale the program to larger inputs or more processes. I'm a Computer Science professor so I might be biased toward emphasizing theory. But I research and do consulting in CPU design, and in this work I have often found myself relying on CS theory to get my work done. For example, I need to simulate the operation of a microprocessor for billions of instructions, which can be very time consuming. One simulator I was using was taking far too long to finish and it was making it hard for me to get work done; I had to wait many hours for the program to finish. I used what I know about performance debugging to find the problem. The problem was a loop that was doing an associative lookup inefficiently. By choosing a different data structure and restructuring some loops, I doubled the speed of the program, saving a lot of time. Another time a graduate student came to me and said \"this program you asked me to write takes more than 24 hours to run.\" I looked at his code for 5 minutes and said \"use a map instead of a list.\" He did that and the program took like 30 seconds. Those are examples that stick out in my mind, but I end up using the stuff I learned in data structures and analysis of algorithms classes a lot. We can think about Dijkstra's algorithm in particular. You might never need to code it for a job. Someone's already done that and stuck it in a library for you to use. But understanding it and its analysis gives you all kinds of benefits. First, you know when using Dijkstra's algorithm is the right choice and when it might be overkill, or conversely not enough (when you also study Floyd's algorithm). The idea of a greedy algorithm, and the idea of dynamic programming come up in many places in programming and Dijkstra's algorithm is a great example to get you thinking about those topics. You could first study a naive algorithm to solve single-source-shortest path, see where that doesn't work so well, and then appreciate Dijkstra's algorithm and generalize that appreciation to other situations where the brute-force approach isn't the best. You mentioned sorting, which is another great example of where a putting a little thought into a divide-and-conquer approach can yield huge benefits over a simpler but inefficient method. It's true that you can do a lot of significant programming work without knowing all the theory, but your work will be higher quality and more scalable with the CS theory background. There are also other sides to theory e.g. computability and complexity theory, formal languages, quantum computing, etc. that one can make (slightly less convincing) arguments for, but that might be a discussion for another time.",
        "That theory IS computer science, the very essence. You are acting like the \u201cjob\u201d for computer science is software developer - however, unless you are doing some sort of applied/professional degree, it is not. If there is any job a CS degree aims to train you for, it is \u201ccomputer scientist\u201d - an academic, who researches how computation works. I also think that it probably helps you become a better software developer, but that is not the goal at all. The goal is to give you a better perspective on the theoretical side of computation - which is comouter science. This is kind of like a mathematics student asking \u201cI am not sure why I am learning all this topology and abstract algebra, I am not sure how this will help me become a better quantitative trader\u201d, or a philosophy student asking \u201cI am not sure why I am learning all this metaphysics and theory of mind, how will this help me become a better lawyer\u201d.",

Knowledge serves both a positive function (what to do) and a negative function (what not to do). Unlike someone without a good education in CS, I know what not to waste time on. I know that, for a fixed set of data objects, an index is faster than a list or even a tree. So I know better than to traverse a list of such objects during lookup. Someone with a good education in the basics won't know this. To the objection, \"the standard library handles the implementation details anyway\", the point is that the individual without a good education in CS is liable to re-invent the wheel. Knowing to search the spec for a purpose-built lookup() method that relieves you of having to write your own is part of the payoff of knowing all these \"random facts\" about CS. Knowing *why* you can trust the standard library is another payoff.",

Depth-first searches and breadth-first searches are generally used in anything where you might have... well, a graph of any kind, such as, say, *files and folders*. Bubblesort I couldn't tell you, honestly.",
        "You went to University to study Computer Science, so don't be surprised to find it involves computer science :) What seems to be surprising you is that Computer Science isn't the same thing as Software Engineering. So why do most SE jobs require a CS degree? Simply because if you have a CS degree you'll know enough about computation to be a decent SE. But in truth you don't really need to know anything, a lot of people work as software engineers without a formal qualification. But having a strong understanding of CS fundamentals can save you a lot of leg work, because you'll recognise the underlying computation problems for what they are. Someone with a \"job\" in computer science will work as an actual research scientist at a university, or on the teaching staff. There are a few industrial research positions as well. But CS is very much a science in the same way that Physics is -- i.e. there are no \"Physics\" jobs outside of academia, but lots of jobs (e.g. civil engineering) require a useful understanding of *some* physics."

Best way to learn, also very helpful because now those things can be used as a starting point if we decide to use confluence in Jira for documentation of a project. Try a few methods of documenting, see what works. I think having it in two places, a manual with references and in the code itself is very nice, one allows for quick glance, the other delves deeper. Also best time to start documenting is *now* Another thing, is to have daily meetings, but really short 5 minute ones where people say \"hey I am doing this, I need a help with that, I have nothing to do, can you explain me XYZ\".

If I had to give a specific language I would say learn python, but don't worry about becoming a python expert, employers want developers to be flexible nowadays and to do far more than just programming in one language usually ( in my experience ). Instead learn the logic, learn about loops, variables, conditionals, data types etc and that will give you a transferable skill to basically any programming language. Then play about with different languages and apply the new understanding and see how it translates. Understanding how to write code and how to translate an objective into logic is far more valuable to me as an employer than someone who has read the whole of \"learn to code in python the hard way\" cover to cover. Again, maybe it is an unpopular opinion, but when interviewing people for junior positions, in my experience, understanding of how to achieve something and translating that in a psuedo-code manor is much more valuable than someone who can write a specific language fluently but can't actually work out how to program something. There is a certain \"Developer mindset\" that employers look for in juniors, an ability to think programmatically."

        "I assume you ask about C++'s `std::vector` or Rusts `Vec`? Your understanding seems solid, except that they are never preallocated, they are always allocated during runtime. C++ `std::vector` has a growth policy that guarantees element insertion at the end in amortized constant time. That means that once in a while the insertion will take long (when the vector needs to reallocate), but otherwise it happens in constant time. Especially the average insertion time is constant. This implies that the vector grows exponentially, i.e. it could double in size everytime it grows. Note that only the insertion at the end has amortized constant time complexity. Insertion in the middle is linear in the size of the vector. However in practice even if you regularly insert in the middle, `std::vector` usually beats linked containers like `std::list` in terms of performance, simply due to the better cache locality. Which brings us to the next reason it's considered fast: the memory is not fragmented. It is as densly packed as you can get (assuming your objects are properly packed). This leads to little or no cache misses when you iterate over the vector. Compared to arrays, arrays will always be as fast or faster then vectors, but they are very inflexible because they cannot dynamically grow in size.",

        "It's kind of difficult to explain succinctly, but we basically create meaning out of signals produced by high and low voltages. Having high and low gives you a way to represent 0 and 1, which in turn can be used in clusters to represent bytes. I really recommend this video series by Ben Eater, where you watch the guy do exactly what you're describing -- build up circuits on a breadboard until he's able to show text on a display:",
        "This is a very broad topic, so to keep things brief I'll link to Wikipedia articles where you can find more details. Transistors are arranged into [logic gates], which are functional units that implement various logical functions like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, etc. These functions take binary inputs and map then to a binary output. Logic gates can be further organized into circuits to perform more useful things like adders, multiplexers, demultiplexers, memory cells, etc. [Boolean algebra] is useful for understanding the transformations these circuits perform. The bits that leave a given circuit therefore reflect the result of the logical operations performed on the input to that circuit, and their \"meaning\" depends on the circuits that receive them as input. An basic adder, for example, takes two numbers as input. Both are just high/low or on/off signals on different wires, but the adder circuit is designed to treat those signals as binary digits of numbers and add them together. Adding two binary \"digits\" can be accomplished with an XOR gate and an AND gate. The XOR gate outputs the least significant digit of the result: 0 if both inputs are equal to 0 (0+0=0) or both are equal to 1 (1+1=1**0**). The AND handles the carry/overflow value, only producing 1 if both inputs are 1. Program code eventually gets turned into [machine code], which consists of instructions for the CPU to execute. These instructions consist of an [opcode] (operation code) and and potentially one or more arguments. For example, a command might instruct the CPU to add two values stored in [registers] together and place them in another register. All this functionality is implemented directly in the processor structure as logical circuits. When executing an instruction, the first step is to \"decode\" the iopcode. It's passed through a decoder circuit that maps each [distinct opcode] into a signal on its own unique line. This signal is used by other circuits in the CPU in order to perform the intended operations and properly handle any arguments. The CPU is really just a [giant logic circuit]. Other processing and memory units in a computer work similarly, and CPUs have ports where they can send data to and receive data from other hardware. Software talks to hardware with the help of intermediary programs that handle instructing the CPU to shuffle data around. When you click your mouse, that sends some data to the CPU, which gets collected in memory and interpreted by those intermediary programs, and finally is exposed to software as a click event at the current cursor position. The software might determine that the click was within a button, which triggers a pop-up. This change in the displayed scene eventually makes its way to graphics driver, which sends a bunch of instructions to the CPU that transfer the accompanying data graphics processor, which then turns it into a datastream that the monitor reads to produce the corresponding image on screen. Different hardware pieces will have their own microprocessors that allow incoming instructions to control the hardware."

Me personally, I would choose Rust over C++ because I prefer the more functional style of programming that Rust offers over the more object oriented style of programming that C++ offers. I like everything being immutable by default, which Rust offers. I like that people have to make extra effort to make things mutable in Rust by using the \"mut\" keyword. I like not having to worry about memory leaks by default. I like Rust's powerful switch statements, which is a feature seen in functional languages. I like composition over inheritance, which Rust does. I just personally prefer that style of programming. I mean it doesn't hurt to learn, it expands your brain, but you don't have to learn it if that makes any sense. I guess one plus of that style of programming that Rust teaches is you can sort of learn to program \"Rust style in C++\" which can make your C++ programming better. It makes you more defensive against memory leaks and gets you into the good habit of making everything immutable except for what has to be mutable.

        "You might as well learn Rust, because it's adjacent to cpp. \\- Programming concepts will be very familiar, with Rust simply making some reasonable choices. Stuff like \"match statements must be exhaustive\" saves you from chasing down the errors arising from adding a member to your enum. \\- Modern conveniences like auto-derive for stuff like cloning, equality, and so on. Just keeps the code small. No header/implementation separation. \\- It's not just the memory safety thing, almost every error message in Rust is very well explained. In cpp, you often get pages and pages of error output from very small changes. \\- Cargo is very simple and very well made. CMake by contrast will cause issues, especially when you try to integrate various c and cpp projects.

It is memory safe without sacrificing performance, it has a battery-included package manager which is shipped with the language and everybody use it, it uses a TOML file to configure dependencies, it doesn't have inheritance but relies on composition (through traits, which are basically interfaces) and it uses a lot of functional style programming. Honestly, Rust it's simply a systems language that made the right choices from the beginning. If you want to try it out for hobby projects, go for it. If you want to learn it just to find jobs using Rust, I think it's too soon. Rust is being used more and more everyday, but it's not at a point where there are a lot of job opening for Rust developers."

What you'e looking for, \"uncompiled\", is generally referred to as an \"interpreted language\". So you can do some research on \"compiled\" vs \"interpreted\" for a deep rabbit hole. To give you a very quick (and incomplete/simplified) answer...even at the lowest possible level, binary, binary instruction 01010101010 does not mean the exact same thing on an AMD64 CPU as it does on a MIPS SIMD CPU. But we're generally no talking directly to the CPU, as most personal computer need to go through the Operating system first, so you again have different layers of abstraction between linux, windows, macOS (and all the dozens of sub systems). So if I have a pure compiled language and I want it to run on multiple platforms, then I need to compile my source code into multiple different sets of computer instructions. Basically interpreted languages give us another high level abstraction layer so that we can write code more worried about what the code is supposed to be doing in general and let the runtime figure out how to best tell the computer exactly what to do. There are pros and cons, for example reflection and dynamic typing are much easier to implement with an interpreted language, but they can be slower. Think about javascript. It's running in your browser as-is. You can go look at the code of reddit in your browser. The code that's going to execute in my browser, running on my computer, when I hit this comment button that's going to send these words to reddit's servers are all quite a few layers removed from sending specific binary instructions to a specific CPU."

        "The term can mean different things especially to people who don't know anything about computer science. Probably the most common use is in relation to a system you might buy. i.e. X86 architecture or Apple's M(X) architecture which is ARM.  This refers to the way the processors work.  X86 does some things better, ARM does other things better.  Generally these get classified as CISC and RISC respectively (complex vs reduced instruction set, but those examples are probably easier to understand) It might also mean how the pieces-parts inside a computer talk to each other.  Phones keep most everything on a single chip PC's tend to have individual components which have to talk to each other via a bus, which is essentially a bunch of wires and some smarts to get information from here to there. System on Chips (SOC) systems still have that communication it's just a lot more compressed which has benefits and short-comings.  For instance if you want to replace the graphics card in your PC, you likely can, and often other components like the wifi radios, etc.  Note that this is different than when a manufacturer makes components non-upgradeable as a lot of laptop makers have begun to do with memory and storage.  These still work in the traditional way, they're just soldered in place you can't open it up and swap out a component.  An advantage is sometimes they can be more efficient, and are likely to be more consistent than a system that doesn't know or can't trust what hardware is there. It could also mean software architecture, which is how programs are designed, usually with an intent to enhance and maintain them.  Also their use of other systems, and where they live in the world.",
        "One common use is something like \"ARM architecture\", \"x86 architecture\". In that case, it's talking about the \"instruction set\" that the CPU uses. In ELI5 style, it's the language that the CPU speaks. You can dig deeper into that, talking more about *how* it's designed to \"speak\" that language, and what it does inside to follow the instructions.",
        "You should look more generally than the definitions given here. Computer architecture is really about the individual components of the computer and how they work together. This means caches, memory, CPU, GPU, and so on. What's the use of it? Well it's multi-fold. For one, you need to understand computer architecture to create computers. You need to understand computer architecture to create components for a computer. Soon enough, you'll need to have a good understanding of architecture to write good code on a computer. The hardware we have isn't getting *much* faster due to approaching physical limits, and so software doesn't get a free ride for increasing speed anymore. The next best thing to do as a developer is to understand your architecture and optimize along that path. You sort of see this in a light way with the popularity of parallel algorithms since our architectures now are usually multicore. But if you're implementing something multicore, you need to understand what sort of things can go wrong in terms of false sharing (and some other things). If the developer doesn't care about architecture, you would be writing code as if there were no physical machine running it. You wouldn't focus in on low level details like multicore, space optimization, and things of that nature.",
        "Computer architecture is where rubber meets road. Architecture is the area that studies how to build digital circuits that perform computation. The design of these circuits sets the foundation of what a computer can and cannot do, and how well it can do it. It also sets the foundation of how you write data (programs) that describe how to perform computation. Most programs people write are actually processed by other computer programs until they are finally transformed into the lowest-level language \u201chard wired\u201d into the silicon. The word \u201carchitecture\u201d is overloaded in many contexts, but if people say Computer Architecture as a compound noun they mean the definition I just gave."

        "it was a long, slow way. initially, programs were punched directly in machine codes. but it doesn't mean that they were written directly that way, instead there were mathematicians developing algorithms (probably in math formulas and principal schemas), and programmers converting algos into code. then programmers realized that they could use symbolic language to write machine code (a-la DISTANCE = TIME\\*SPEED) and the process was split into programming using such a symbolic language and coding, i.e. converting it into machine code. the latter was considered a simpler task and was usually performed by operators - they received symbolic code from programmers written on paper, converted it into machine codes and punched codes into paper cards. I think it's why \"coder\" is still used as a derogatory term compared to \"programmer\" - because it initially meant an operator that merely translates a program written by a \"real programmer\" into a machine language. since these symbolic language were parsed by humans, they could use more capabilities than assemblers we know, e.g. using ancient greek letters, indexes and so on - actually anything a concrete operator can recognize and translate into machine codes. note that early computers were extremely expensive and slow, so using their time for the tasks easily performed by humans (as opposed to actual computations where computers were already thousands times faster than humans) was economically inefficient. but just in a few years, things started to change, and autocodes (i.e. programs replacing above-mentioned \"coders\") started to appear. but since they were not as smart as human coders, and their input language was limited to 6-bit encodings popular in 50s, their input language became much simpler and formal compared to that human coders were able to translate. as you can see, we switched from writing programs directly in machine codes to use of autocodes (now called assemblers) in multiple smaller steps, and back in 50s all programmers understood machine codes. moreover, machine codes were developed with the understanding that many people would at least read them, so they were much smaller and easier than modern ones. some of them even encoded an operation type as an EBCDIC character (e.g. A - add, S - subtract...). PS: I wrote in machine codes only once in 80s. We didn't have an assembler for a school computer, so we wrote the program in assembler and then translated it manually. PPS: text editors started to appear only in 60s and became widespread in 70s. Prior to that, people used punched cards to input new data to a computer. Again, computer time was a luxury, while cards could be punched at cheap devices like [that]."

        "That's a great question. Thanks for asking it. I think both you and your devs will be happier as a result of your attention to understanding their perspective. * Estimating task size is hard. It's very common to expect a task to take half a day, and it grows into a week-long project. Hidden complexity is hard to predict. There are [techniques] to mitigate this, but it's the nature of the beast. This is a big reason why Agile is popular: it offers flexibility when things don't go as expected. * [Technical debt] accrues interest. Some PMs always push for new feature work and would rather not \"waste\" time rewriting old code. But the fastest solution is often not the most robust. If you never dedicate resources to making the codebase stronger, you will find that development takes longer and bugs become frequent. By the time you hear devs complain that your codebase is hard to work with, odds are fair that you should have invested in tech-debt months ago. * Ramping up on code takes time, especially as your codebase grows more mature. The more that you can do to keep the same freelance devs working for you, the better they will get at working with your code. * [Code review] helps both your code and your team. It requires devs to write code that others can read, and it prevents [siloing] -- that is, it means that you don't have just one expert on each section of code. * [Documentation] is a great way to demystify code, but it needs to be prioritized. If you don't ask for documentation, odds are that it won't get written. * Engage your devs in designing your process, and your process will be dev-compatible. (But please, [timebox] these discussions to mitigate [context-switching] Do you know what kind of process will your dev team be using? Will they be on-site or remote? Agile/waterfall/other? How many devs? How big is the tech project? Any other info you can provide? The more concrete information you can share, the more helpful we can be.",

        "Every dev thinks they're superman and hate to say no. If they give you a time estimate, never tell your client or stakeholders that time estimate - you should double it or triple it at least, because apart from anything else the dev is probably estimating time to complete *development*. That doesn't include testing, bug fixing, unforeseen time sucks etc. Don't tell the dev you doubled it, and remind them regularly of what they said, but also be understanding that issues do come up and devs the world over share the same problem of sucking at giving time estimates to their manager. Better yet, don't ask for time estimates. Instead adopt sprint or kanban and you'll have full visibility of development. Get your devs to always be keeping the dev branch stable, so if at some point you decide ok - we'll cut this branch here and make a release then it won't take long for the dev to give you a releasable piece of code. Edit: Also - good devs will appreciate it if you tell them *why* something is being created and what the overall mission is. This is generally the better approach than telling them *what* you want them to make and *how* to make it. They may surprise you with a different approach that's quicker, cheaper and achieves most of the same goals, maybe even more goals."

Originally your API was called the BIOS, Basic Input Output System and it let you read and write to devices on your computer, such as the screen, keyboard, mouse, floppy drive, hard drive, etc. But even if you wrote a console application in C you used the stdio.h API to do this and most console application written in C still do this, even though the OS has equivalent functions. If you go back to old DOS games and you'll see you had to select which Sound Card you had installed, because the API to each sound card was different. So Microsoft added a standard API in Windows so you could play sound from your program without worrying about which sound card was installed, the wonderfully named sndPlaySound function. It abstracted the hardware away from the program by putting an API in between. That is the model for most APIs on an OS, it abstracts hardware or system specific implementations away from the programs running on the OS. If your OS comes with a graphical interface, it will provide and API to create a window and draw stuff on the window to make it useful. APIs for using the graphics card are not standardized, OpenGL is most common, but DirectX is Windows only. A lot of things haven't been abstracted away into an API yet. Reading and writing from a database ,for example. Windows does have ODBC which was an effort to do it, Java has JDBC , but no OS has a native API that lets you connect and use a SQL database server in a generic way.",

It\u2019s true that auto implemented properties with public get and set act like public member variables in some ways.

      "output": [
        "Well, it's defined that way. When a memory read is performed, it always reads into the MDR. Think of the MDR like a staging buffer for either instructions or data. It's a place to go very shortly after the instructions or data are available. Could you save some time moving it directly into the CIR? Possibly, but you'd also complicate your memory interface by having to specify this is an instruction access vs data access so that it gets written back into the right place. The real world concern is that if you remove the CIR, your cycle time gets longer because the instructions now have to propagate farther in the machine to the CIR. Keep in mind this is a toy architecture. The design tradeoffs that you see here do not necessarily correspond to the real world.",
        "What architecture are you talking about? It's entirely possible to have these steps work without a CIR or an MDR, or to have even more temporary registers in between, should the designer wish for such an arrangement. I guess your question is ultimately \"Why do memory loads go into the MDR and THEN the register, rather than directly to the register?\", and there are many answers, but one that I would say are important are: It means the CPU's various internal buses would be directly attached to it's external data bus. This means that every time the bus data lines cycle those internal data lines cycle, and vice versa. In CMOS you can trigate them to help disconnect, but you're always loading and storing from memory so it's still going to happen. That's a lot of switching when you don't need it, which means more robustness from glitching. It also means the fan-out and set-up and hold-times are completely dictated by your external bus. Can the gates that make up your registers even drive that competitively huge data bus, for example? How slow is a line like that to rise and fall? The point of having buffers going to and from memory is to help disconnect the internal circuits from the external ones by going through a beefy register that is designed for that specific task. And the current instruction is data like any other, so it needs to go via that special buffer.",
        "The MDR is literally just the latches that the data bus pins are connected to. When you read from memory, it has to go through the data bus, because that's the only thing that's wired to the memory, and that means it has to go to the MDR, because that's the only thing on the CPU that's wired to the memory data bus. If you arranged it so you had a switch that could directly connect the CIR to the data bus, then whenever it was switched to CIR mode, you would have to coordinate CIR accesses with the memory timing. When the data bus is in transition, the CIR will be in transition. This probably isn't what you want - you want microcode or combinatorial logic or whatever to be able to \"look at\" the CIR to control its operations throughout the cycle. And of course you would still need both registers. If you're doing a memory fetch, you have to keep the instruction around during the cycle when you actually fetch the memory, so you know what to do with it. So you're not really saving anything, either."

      "output": [
        "The thing people refer to as the \"TokTok algorithm\" or the \"YouTube algorithm\" is a recommendations engine. It takes as input which videos you've watched (and maybe other information it has about you, like who you follow etc), and produces as output a list of videos that you might want to watch. To see how this might work, suppose instead of videos we are trying to build a recommendation engine for short works of fiction. We have a user who's read 10 stories, and a database of millions of stories, and we want to choose some to recommend to that user. One way to do this, that is relatively easy to explain but that probably wouldn't work all that well in the real world, would be to make a database of all the unique words in each story. Some words are so common as to be worthless, so let's throw out any words that, let's say, 25% or more of all stories have. So now we have a \"fingerprint\" of each story, a set of relatively-unique words that the story has. We can then construct a similar \"fingerprint\" of the user, by grouping together the unique words in the stories they've read. We can construct some distance metric - number of shared words is the obvious one - that lets us measure the similarity of two fingerprints. The user's recommendations are simply those stories most similar to what they've already read. Our recommendations are pretty pathetic at this point, so we hire statisticians, who look at things like frequency distributions, correlations, etc., and come up with a scheme that prioritizes some words that we think really indicate user characteristics over other words that we think don't. We can make various other ad-hoc interventions that we think produce \"better\" recommendations. Eventually the engine becomes complex enough that you can't really point to one thing it does - it's no longer just a word counter, it does all kinds of other things and mixes them together in some proprietary blend designed by the statisticians and software developers. Then it turns out that this is a kind of problem naturally suited to AI and artificial neural networks. You have a large volume of data about which recommendations were offered and which ones the user clicked on, so this can form a training dataset. Initially, training the AI is essentially just teaching it to run the recommendations engine you already developed. But then you can continue training it, and maybe it comes up with something that works better than what you had before (\"better\" in the sense of \"more people actually click on more of the offered items\"). However, once you've handed the reins over to AI, specifically an AI that uses artificial neural networks, it is notoriously difficult to discern what it's actually doing. Its training and refinement develops an algorithm, but we can't introspect it and say \"aha, it's giving 10% preference to videos that are optimistic.\" That might be exactly what it's doing, and we might discover that by watching its behavior, but we can't dissect it and find the \"optimism evaluator\" subroutine. There are no subroutines, it's just a huge number (billions) of weights and thresholds in mathematical devices called perceptrons. If the recommendation engine starts making recommendations in some way we find unacceptable, like using racial bias in a bad way or something like that, the company risks embarrassment, so they try to train it not to do that. But given our inability to understand what's really going on internally, this is quite difficult to do. Sometimes the output of the AI is filtered by an external, hand-coded safety layer. There are interesting applications where a second, independently trained AI is used to quality check the output of the first AI. It gets very complicated. As to addictive behavior, this is of course incentivized by the business structures of the companies. The goal of the recommendations engine, and thus the reward function for the AI (as well as the evaluation for the bonuses of the human statisticians), is \"maximize the number of times people keep clicking on new content rather than leaving the site.\" Human statisticians might feel conflicted over using human psychology to get people addicted so they just keep clicking, but AI only cares about this if someone trains it to.",
        "Most social media sites have some kind of scrollable \"feed\" of content. This feed can be very simple: in a Twitter-like setting the platform could show you every tweet from every user you follow in chronological order from most recent to older. However, if you follow lots of users and only check Twitter periodically then it may be more useful to show you the \"good\" tweets that you've missed since last time, so it might show tweets from users you follow, roughly chronologically, but prioritizing tweets that have received lots of likes/retweets/comments that you haven't already interacted with. This change alone can massively amplify \"viral\" content, because posts that receive lots of engagement get aggressively shown to everyone that follows the account, and popular replies get shown to everyone that follows those accounts, further boosting the engagement of both, etcetera. On some platforms, particularly video sites like YouTube, most of the videos recommended to you are not from accounts you explicitly follow, but are \"recommended\" based on content you've previously engaged with. This has an even larger magnifying effect, because now a \"cute animal video\" or \"controversial political video\" won't just be shown to a list of followers, but will be recommended to entire broad categories of viewers. The objective of these recommendation algorithms is typically to get you to spend more time on the platform to increase ad revenue; following this objective alone can have a \"radicalizing\" effect where the system recommends increasingly shocking, upsetting, or extreme content to lure a viewer into watching one more video. This doesn't need to be an explicit choice by the programmers, like \"the user likes videos of extremism 4, let's try recommended videos at level 5,\" but can occur automatically through statistics \"when we show viewers in cluster X videos from group Y they tend to spend more time on the platform.\" I don't study or use TikTok, so I can't speak to their algorithm in particular, but that's an explanation of social media recommendation algorithms in general.",
        "Usually that's closed source and nobody outside the company knows what it is exactly. But the general way to do these kinds of things is called machine learning. The basic idea is they take your data, they run a statistical test to see what you would be most interested in, and then they use that to decide what content to feed you. it's continuously self correcting so it'll eventually find something you like as long as you keep using it and feeding it data."

And it applies to all CPU registers and other observable properties of the CPU's state, not just the program counter. (The program counter is a bit easier to deal with than other registers, because the PC value is reliably known when the instruction is fetched. So as you suggested, it can just be propagated through the pipeline along with the instruction. On the other hand, if you simultaneously issue instructions i1 and i2, but i2 reads a register that i1 writes, then you have a problem.

Some internal software library will convert the problem into a BigNum ... there is no universal standard of what a BigNum is, it's just some arbitrary-precision number format. One way to implement a BigNum is to calculate in \"base 2^64 \" which means that each register value is itself treated as a \"digit\". Some very sloppy envelope calculations gives about 650k bits width of the final result, which is about 10,000 of these BigNum \"digits\". Throwing in a couple other simplifying assumptions (ask if interested), this works out to about 250 million multiplies and adds. An add always completes in one cycle and multiplies can complete in 1 or 2 cycles on a typical modern CPU. So, 250 million multiplies and adds at 2 GHz works out to about 250 milliseconds (with some specialized optimizations [ask if interested], the speed might be cut in half or less). Note that this is assuming perfect pipeline conditions, no interrupts, no exceptions, perfect looping, etc. But yes, a large operation like 50,000! can easily complete in a fraction of a second on a modern CPU. What is truly mind-boggling is when you translate that over to a GPU. You can do all the same operations on the GPU, but a modern SOTA GPU like the RTX 3090 can parallelize by a factor 10,000-fold or more. So, a modern GPU could perform 10,000 calculations of 50,000! (or a similar operation) in 250 milliseconds without breaking a sweat. And as impressive as that might feel, it really doesn't capture the full magnitude of what a modern GPU can do. If you have a modern desktop computer with high core-count and a recent GPU, you *really do* have a machine sitting on your desk that, 25 years ago, would have classed as a super-computer.",

Clock cycles don't translate exactly to machine instructions -- one instruction can take multiple clock cycles to execute, and conversely, different parts of the CPU can be simultaneously working on different operations within the same clock cycle. But it's in the right ballpark. Clever algorithms can help as well. For small integers (small enough to fit into a CPU register) the CPU can perform multiplication in \"constant time\", but for really big numbers, you have to come up with an algorithm to break the work up into smaller chunks. A naive approach, using the same \"long multiplication\" algorithm that you learned in elementary school, can multiply two k-bit integers in O(k^(2)) steps. But for very large integers, there are divide-and-conquer strategies that are more efficient. [This paper] describes an algorithm that can calculate n! in O(n (log n)^(3) log log n) time. So in summary, it's not at all implausible that a well-designed computer algebra system could calculate 50000! in less than a second."

There are BSD boxes that have run for months without a reboot (some even years) * Cost -- Linux has no nasty license headaches * Open Source (for the most part) - meaning if you need to change something, you can.",

I know also that in research, a lot of workloads were run on Unix workstations at least through the 90's, and those were eventually replaced by Linux due to cost. I think any modern and relevant software/IT education program is doing students a huge disservice in not making at least a basic Linux introduction part of the curriculum. It is unavoidable unless you're writing strictly desktop Windows or macOS software.",

        "All 3 mainstream operating systems perform well. However Linux is easier to set up for a particular need, and it's easy to replicate that setup (ex. SteamOS), and it can be quite efficient at resource usage. On top of that, developers and scientists rely a lot on open source software - from someone's Julia scripts to heavily optimized C code. Sometimes they aren't distributed as end products (binaries), and need to be compiled. Linux is the easiest to do this on. This is exactly the workflow that Linux is built around, unlike the other 2 operating systems. Lastly, MacOS just limits the devices you can use for computing, and Windows has built-in (license) hardware limitations, which is OK for quite powerful workstations, but if you need something bigger than that - Linux is a better bet. On Linux, all you care about is just having enough hardware. Things work.",

        "There's a lot of reasons. One is inertia. Back in the 80's/90's, a DOS/Windows PC just wasn't particularly useful as a serious tool. You weren't going to set up a compute cluster running Windows 95 and pay an intern to reboot nodes every few minutes. Nothing would ever get done. These days, Windows is a \"real\" operating system, and it's perfectly capable of being used on servers and such. But it's a massive pain to administer and deploy at scale. It's fine if you need to admin a bunch of laptops and desktops. With Linux, you can scale down to weird micro projects. You can scale up to big Super clusters. You can write some configuration code to autodeploy, and send it to another site and they can reproduce your work without calling Microsoft to re-activate disk images with different licensing. If you need to use some state of the art protocol for your research, just run a custom kernel modified for the project. Linux desktops tend to come with everything you need for \"technical computing\" out of the box. Write bash, perl, python, whatever. One command to install a compiler toolchain. Windows comes with the MS X Box Game eleet xtreme gamer pro toolbar for recording your video game playing. Installing the stuff a technical user needs is all extra work and management overhead. Having your home directory mounted over NFS if you are in a lab \"just works.\" Linux took over the server space during the Dot Com boom. So it inherited the cloud computing space when all the dot coms moved to the cloud. So if you want to rent a million cores for a day, it is way easier to do that in the cloud with Linux, even on Azure.",

With Linux, you build it with only the components your ATM will need. This will save a ton of memory, and will be more secure, since there wont be thousands of unused libraries waiting to be exploited.",
        "I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!",
        "I'm a computational physicist at a national lab. Here's how I see it 1. History definitely plays a part. Most scientific code is inherited to some extent. My graduate work was entirely done on a fortran code that started life in the 80s and modified over 30+ years by various graduate students. It was compiled on unix-like systems originally and then on linux once it became popular in the 90s. All of the compile scripts use bash, the environment variables assume linux. Basically, I won't be surprised if porting to windows involved months of work for not that much gain. 2. All of the top supercomputers run linux. Again, some of this is down to history, but primarily this is because supercomputer OSs/scheduling software is a niche market. You're maybe selling O(500) licenses/year and they involve a lot of optimization and skilled man hours. This is not to mention all of the support tickets from \"very important scientists\" who needed their code running yesterday. Your clients are also NSF funded or similar, so they are limited in how much they can pay. It's far more efficient to let the open source folks volunteer time and get it all working while Microsoft et al. focus on the far more lucrative workstation/home computer market. 3. Because of (1), most physics graduate students who use significant computing time end up very familiar with linux. So, when a national lab is looking for an OS for their in-house cluster, it makes a lot of sense to stick with what most of their employees are familiar with. Microsoft's free/cheap office licenses to college students trick works great the other way too! 4. On bash scripts etc.: These are invaluable in a scientific computing environment (no matter what the OS is). Remember, most people developing scientific code don't have a software engineering background. They're just STEM majors who took one class on C++. You're not going to find well designed, user tested GUI. These codes usually take in text input files and spit out 10+ binary output files (with very unintuitive names a lot of the time). Those bash scripts are essential in organizing different runfiles. The fact that linux uses them extensively is a feature, not a bug.",
        "It's not Linux, it's the scientific community. Lots of science departments get less money than the football program and what they do get is largely spent on very expensive instrumentation. Computers had to be cheap, reliable, able to interface with anything, and modified, programmed, and run by crazy nerds. You could almost build a complete Linux box for the price of a Microsoft software license, and early Windows was very hard to interface to weird stuff. By the time MS was producing software that was easy to interface to non-standard peripherals, science was populated by people who knew Linux like they knew metric. Business bought MS to solve business problems which are easy to cost-analyze. Science is mostly not about making a profit and it is harder to justify costly equipment when cheaper alternatives are available. It's also an ego thing. I know Linux and you only know Windows so I'm better than you, even if you make many times more money and benefits than I do. Just as a side note. Both Apple and Microsoft have \"reconfigured\" their OS kernels to largely duplicate Linux internals. Also a huge percentage of business backroom products like servers, routers, etc. run on Linux. A company named Red hat had a lot to do with this. Today Linus runs on computers the size of a pack of gum and embedded Linux is everywhere. Linux is easy to run without users, keyboards, monitors etc.",
        "Others have already highlighted the general reasons why everything that isn't end-user tends to run on Linux (and a lot of stuff that is!), but specifically in scientific communities there is also the fact that a lot of research is government driven, and many governments have a bias against dependency on specific companies when possible: in my country we've had several governmental agencies move away from Microsoft based systems as a way specifically to avoid said dependency. This is on top of the other points like costs, bureaucracy involved in dealing with licensing (especially when dealing with cross country collaboration) and plain old tradition. When 35%+ of the investment in R+D comes from governments, and many companies that deal in such end interfacing with universities for data and stuff, it normally lends itself to moving towards Linux as an industry standard",
        "The main reason Linux is still alive today is the lack of desktop. Not having a gui (or option to run without) means you can run a server or crunch data with lower hardware requirements and it can do more. Lower resource requirements results in more stability because there's more headroom and less software that could have an issue. That mattered a lot back in the day. We were very constrained by the processors, hard drive speeds, and max ram.",
        "It's far more convenient to program on, in my experience. It's basically an OS made by programmers for programmers. Most of the C build system is natively Linux/Unix based and the Windows equivalents are replacements or ports. This may be less true these days, but back in ~2005 it was way more \"natural\" to write code on Linux. Also, there's less bloat. My office pc now has thousands of times the computing power that my pc did 20 years ago, but it takes longer to do basic shit (like open a PDF or complete a boot-up) now than it did then. *What the hell is Windows computing with all those extra cycles?!* Meanwhile, Linux can be extremely bare bones if you want it to be, so all this miraculous computing power can be directed at the scientific computation you're working on.",
        "You have always been using Linux. You just did not realize it. Almost all websites are hosted on servers that run Linux. Most every internet-connected service you have ever seen or used was running on Linux. Linux is how work gets done. People that need to do work with computers overwhelmingly choose Linux."

In most professions and educational experiences, this is an anomaly to be avoided, and a sign of personal failure in some way. In programming this is a core part of the job, not an anomaly. It happens every 1-3 weeks. Understanding this can make your journey to competence much less frustrating and painful, and therefore also faster and smoother. Knowing you WILL get stuck, and make the wrong choices, again and again (and again), and again, helps you develop skills and strategies and heuristics for knowing how to navigate those moments. When to persevere, when to ask for help, when to pair programme, when to take a break, what kind of tools to use, how to manage blockers or being a blocker, etc. Modularity. Break down everything into components: your time; your problems; the application; each function, your tasks, tickets, goals, team processes. Learn to think in those terms at every stage of the programming process. What could work on its own and combine with something else to make something bigger work? Build/test/deploy/debug that. Communication. Professional software development is in 99% of cases a social endeavour. Someone with superb communication skills and moderate competence will almost always add exponentially more value than the opposite. Understand, lean into, and add value to the social dimension of your programming tasks. In your team, in teams that depend on your work, in relation to customers, and business owners, even in relation to your family and private life. Programming doesn't happen in a computer only, or perhaps primarily. It happens in a team, business, and life context. It is easier to debug the code, than to debug the relationships you depend on to build good code. Technical competence still matters, there's a minimum threshold. But past that threshold, communication wins, in my experience."

I have written plenty of C on machines with 16kb of flash and 1k of RAM, in that environment you cannot have stuff pulled in that you don't need. Further when C was designed the machines the tools needed to run on were SEVERELY limited, and only needing to load one source file at a time before compiling (maybe multiple passes each writing a new intermediate file) then linking it all together at the end was the way to minimise memory consumption by the compiler. This imposes some interesting constraints on language design, hence the use of the header file to minimise errors due to calling library code with the wrong function prototype.",

I/O is dependant on the hardware, so it was always supplied as a library. You can write your own special I/O if you like. As machines (even small ones) become faster and memory smaller, faster and greater capacity; them application software gets more and more remote from the actual machine code. But the Kernel is still machine code at its base level, that is the only thing the electronic gates can obey.",

If they baked it into the core language, they would have been stuck with it.

      "output": [
        "Basically, filesystems and storage devices got better. There used to be limits to the number of files that could be in a directory without killing performance. In those days I recall that on a FIDOnet mail distribution server, sorting the mail was slower than defragmenting the drive and then sorting the mail, because a fragmented file was literally thousands of times slower to read. But in the late 90s to early 2000s, HDDs started coming with significant amounts of on-device cache and the ability to serve multiple requests (scatter-gather), and operating systems started taking advantage of this (not to mention implementing caching strategies of their own). Today nobody bothers defragging drives (even when they still have spinning drives where \"defragging\" is a concept), because it gives no meaningful performance benefit any more. And for the same reason, if you have a million files, there's no longer much of a reason to split them into a thousand directories of a thousand files each - the single million-file directory isn't going to bog things down as it did in the past. (Thoigh there's still \\_some\\_ limit - a billion files might still give you hiccups. But the new limits are less likely to be reached in practice.)",
        "It's not that there's *no* penalty for storing many small files, but the penalty is much smaller now that pretty much everyone is using solid state storage instead of magnetic hard drives. Magnetic hard drives are extremely slow to \"seek\" to a given region of the disk, because they have to physically move a head and wait for the platter to spin to the correct position. So you get a huge performance benefit from consolidating your I/O into a small number of contiguous blocks. SSDs, on the other hand, have no moving parts so the time to \"move\" from one region to another is much smaller (but still non-zero). As a very rough estimate, a single seek on a consumer magnetic HDD is roughly as expensive as sequentially reading 1MB or so of data, whereas for SSDs it's more like tens of KB. In addition, most SSDs can execute many independent requests in parallel, because internally they're organized kind of like a RAID-0 array of flash chips (the flash memory controller hides this from the host computer). So if the application can benefit from that parallelism, then the speed benefit of SSDs is even greater. ---- Also, of course, because computers are so much faster now than in the 1960s, many software developers don't pay as much attention to optimization as back then, because the hardware is fast enough that they can get acceptable performance without doing so.",

The machines you started with may have used core memory for primary storage (i.e. the storage directly addressable by the CPU, often acting like modern RAM). Your secondary storage might have been tape, with a very long seek time (linear to the difference from the current address, rather than something close to constant like later technologies). Core memory fell to semiconductor-based memory. Drum and tape *mostly* fell to spinning magnetic hard drives and floppy drives (tape survives as an archival medium). Floppy drives fell to semiconductor memory, in the form of USB \"keys\" that use flash memory. Classic magnetic hard drives have been relegated to mostly needs that are slower, but cheaper for the capacity, like mass data storage. Today, you mostly want your OS and major programs stored in flash memory; the cost has come down, and the very low latencies make for a very nice, snappy user experience."

Long term, I suggest getting the degree. Short term, if you don't jump into that, applying to lots of places at entry level you might get lucky, but you'll still want to move around and grow your skills to get into a position you'd really want, and the process will take years.

        "I think that article is so sloppy that it's almost meaningless, so you shouldn't take it too seriously. \"Eventual consistency\" is a technical term with a precise definition, which applies to systems for replicating *data*. A \"scalar clock\" as described by this article (that is, a [Lamport timestamp] is *not* a data replication system, although it could be used as a building block for such a system. So it doesn't really make sense to talk about the \"consistency\" of the clock timestamps, and it's certainly not true that all of the timestamps are guaranteed to eventually converge to the same value. The difference between scalar and vector clocks does have to do with the causal ordering of events. Let's say event A \"happens before\" B (denoted as A\u2192B) if there is *some* way that A could have been the cause of an effect at B. If A and B happened on the same machine, this just depends on local chronological time. If they happened on different machines, then it depends on whether there was some *communication* that may have carried information from A to B -- either directly or indirectly. Note that for any two different events on the *same* machine, either A\u2192B or B\u2192A. But if they happened on *different* machines, then it's possible that *neither* event \"happened-before\" the other. In this case, we say the events were concurrent. This is a property of the events themselves, and does **not** have depend on any particular scheme that we might come up with to assign timestamps to those events. The key difference between scalar and vector clocks is that if A\u2192B, then a scalar clock guarantees that A's timestamp will be lower than B's timestamp (A.ts < B.ts). But the reverse is not necessarily true. If A.ts < B.ts, then it *might be* true that A\u2192B, or they might be concurrent events; all we know is that B\u219bA. In other words, the scalar clock respects the causal order of events, but it can arbitrarily \"break ties\" for events that were concurrent; it will assign them different timestamps in one order or the other. In contrast, vector clocks maintain information about the partial order of events. They still guarantee that if A\u2192B, then A.ts < B.ts. But they *also* guarantee the opposite: if A.ts < B.ts, then A\u2192B. That means that if two events are concurrent (that is, A\u219bB and B\u219bA) then we can *tell* that they're concurrent by looking at their vector clock timestamps. Vector clocks by themselves don't make anything consistent, but they can be used as a building block in consistent systems."

ChatGPT may affect the latter, but it is unlikely to do anything at all to the former.

Large neural network architecture is still an active research area likely to generate more published work, and some of this work may have immediate application in making LLMs better. LLMs aren't driving computer science - computer science research is driving LLMs. The more commercially valuable LLMs become, the more likely it is that research dollars will continue to flow to this subfield of computer science. People at the bottom end of the software development food chain - people who up to now have mostly been copy-and-pasting from Stack Overflow and Reddit - will now start to copy-and-paste from ChatGPT. This will mostly affect the relative fortunes of Prosus and OpenAI, I think. It's possible that a future LLM might be able to do the job of a programmer at some point in the future. We're not there is, but it's hard to predict how fast these things will arrive. It was already possible for pre-OpenAI NLP systems to do the job of writing bottom-tier SEO copy. ChatGPT is likely to eat into this market. I'm not sure how soon an LLM will be able to produce an opinion article of comparable quality _and insight_ to the Washington Post or New York Times.

        "As a couple of others have said, technically nothing. You can mess with on OS\u2019s stuff from another booted OS. But I think that kind of avoids the spirit of your question. You mostly have to intentionally take user action to do this, and I think your question is \"how do the two systems avoid accidentally using each others storage and messing things up?\" And the answer there is partitions and filesystems. Forget dual boot for a minute. If you just go buy an unformatted 2TB SSD and put it in a brand new computer, at first you can\u2019t boot it. There\u2019s no OS installed. So I decide to install Windows 11 from a USB drive. At some point, it will ask me to partition and format the drive. Let\u2019s say I create a 100GB partition and format it as NTFS and install Windows on it. When I reboot at the end, Windows will have a C drive with 100GB of space, some of it used by Windows itself, the rest free. You and I know there is another 1.9TB of \"free space\", because we know it\u2019s a 2TB drive. But the OS isn\u2019t working at that level. It\u2019s not directly addressing sectors of the physical disk. It\u2019s working through the abstraction layer of the NTFS filesystem. When it wants to save a new file, it\u2019s asking the filesystem for free blocks. The filesystem is a specific set of data stored within each partition that records which sectors are free, which are used, which file names map to which locations, etc. If the filesystem only can refer to the 100GB partition it\u2019s on, then it\u2019s physically impossible for Windows to accidentally write a file to someone else\u2019s partition. Windows does have partitioning programs that can manage the physical disk, just like Linux does. And you can use those tools to expand filesystems or add and remove them. That means you could for example use the Windows disk manager to say, \"go delete those other partitions and expand this partition to fill the freed space\", and if the partitions you deleted contained your Linux filesystems, then you\u2019ll have lost your Linux data. That\u2019s what I mean by it requiring intentional user action. But nothing other than those special tools ever sees the whole disk. They just see partitions through the lens of a supported filesystem, and that provides the isolation. The way you make a filesystem accessible to the OS is by \"mounting\" it. Windows is pretty limited in this regard, but Linux systems know how to deal with just about any filesystem. So you can mount your Windows NTFS formatted C drive in Linux, and if you do, the picture changes somewhat. The OS still won\u2019t \"get confused\" and mess with your data, because even though I can now write data to the Windows drive, it has access to the same filesystem information that windows has. So it knows which sectors are free or used by Windows and will choose to write a new file you want to save to the free sectors and correctly update the filesystem. It\u2019s the filesystem that controls all this, and Linux understands the NTFS filesystem just like Windows does. But you can now more easily make mistakes and mess things up. Once the filesystem is mounted, you could accidentally run the wrong delete command or whatever and destroy data on the Windows drive. But it still requires user error (or a bug in software somewhere). Edited to add that I love this question. I was a CS professor for a while, and the best types of questions are the ones where someone has clearly tried to understand something on their own terms, built up a mental model of how it works, and then realized that their model is missing something fundamental and asked the question of \"why doesn\u2019t this thing I would have expected to happen not happen?\""

We had pretty big ones in Hungary and Malaysia in particular. For a while, leadership was talking about doing 50% of our development in the US and 50% overseas. But that just never worked. While we could do many smaller projects overseas, anything really big and critical ran into trouble and had to be brought back onshore. That's not because there's anything wrong with Hungarian or Malaysian engineers, but the best ones are still expensive, and many of them have moved to the US anyway. So going there because it's cheap is a bit like going to Alabama because it's cheap. Good luck with that. The idea of outsourcing engineering jobs to the lowest bidder doesn't make much sense once you get beyond the superficial idea of \"it's all just a big lanky primate typing on a keyboard\", it's a lot more complex than that."

        "This general topic is called [rasterization]. [Scanline rendering] is one straightforward way of implementing it. Basically, you first have to do a [perspective transform] to go from 3D coordinates in space to 2D coordinates in the \"image plane\". Then you can take that 2D triangle, and process one row of pixels (a \"scanline\") at a time. Since a triangle is convex, its intersection with a line is a line segment; you just need to compute the left/right bounds of the triangle's intersection with that scanline, and draw the resulting pixels to the screen. For each pixel, you then do whatever calculations are necessary to compute its final color, such as lighting calculations or texture lookups. (As a simple example, [diffuse \"Lambertian\" lighting] requires computing the dot product of the lighting direction and the surface normal vector for each pixel.) In general, there's not a lot of opportunity to reuse these computations from one rendered frame to the next, because (for instance) even a slight change in camera angle might require every single image pixel to be recomputed. In some situations, it's possible to cache and reuse e.g. lighting information, in cases where it's expected to be mostly static over time. (For instance, older game engines typically used \"baked lighting\" that was precomputed once when a map was designed; some modern game engines use more sophisticated techniques to do the same thing in quasi-real-time.) The reason 3D rendering is so fast nowadays is because we have powerful GPUs which are designed to perform massive numbers of these rendering calculations in parallel, on the order of 10s-100s of billions per second. CPU-based rendering isn't remotely competitive in terms of performance."

Most of the software was written by the CTO, with occasional contributions from contractors. We technically had version control through SVN. But here's the thing. The CTO had planned a major version upgrade back in 2005. So he branched the codebase. Fair and reasonable. He worked on new features in the branch, and continued with maintenance on the trunk to keep up with business. But... weeks turned into months into years, and the version upgrade was never complete. My gig with the company was over 10 years after that happened, and both branches were still being actively developed. Not only that, but the final build was dependent on both branches! Each branch had certain features that the other one didn't have yet. So if you wanted to build the application, you had to checkout both branches into expected locations, and then run the build system (a terrifying, interconnected web of bash scripts). Not to mention: all of the above was just the core application. But the application supported client-specific customizations and ad-hoc JS scripts, which were \\_not\\_ in version control. Every time we scored a new client, we would spend several FTE-days importing and testing the customizations and scripts by hand.

Before that, I had done an internship at another lab, and the code (much smaller) I worked on was also in Fortran. But that was a piece of legacy code. None of the projects at my current lab (at least my closer collaborators) are in Fortran that I know of. However we still occasionally use libraries written in Fortran. C++ is prefered. I find some meta-programming concepts can really help. Basically you can write \"dynamic hardcoded\" functions using template parameters. I've managed to write generic functions that can be as fast as their hard-coded counterparts in Fortran (or C++, whatever), where dynamic functions (no hardcoded parameters) would be much much slower (e.g. 10x). But the applications of the things C++ brings to the table are relatively niche. And it is overall a much more complicated language to use. So I think depending on circumstances, I might still use Fortran in future projects. More generally, if you look at most libraries for scientists, like numerical linear algebra, optimization, etc... you'll find at the very least a Fortran interface.

On some monitors, if the gun is continuously fired at a certain spot for a very long time (days, weeks or months), the coating can be damaged, causing a \"ghost image\" to permanently appear. \"Screen savers\" are named that because they literally save your screen from damage. The first screen savers did just blank the screen on inactivity, defined as lack of keyboard activity. But this required them to redirect the OS's interrupt handler for the keyboard to their own wrapper, which is only possible in a system without kernel protection like an MS-DOS or very early Windows machine. Since the usefulness of a screen saver had been proven, once PC OSs got protected mode kernels, they also added screen savers. This was when they started putting pretty patterns on the screen instead of just blanking it, though a blank screen was always an option. Sleep modes didn't appear until people routinely needed to run computers on batteries (initially laptops, then later smartphones). In the early era of desktop PCs, electricity was cheap and performance was barely adequate to begin with, so computers weren't generally designed with much focus on power savings."

      "output": [
        "There's certainly a strong resemblance between G\u00f6del incompleteness and Turing uncomputability. But I don't think this relates to undefined behavior in programming languages. For example, universal Turing machines themselves do not have any undefined behaviors, and neither do perceptron-based ANNs. The reason real-world programming languages have undefined behaviors is not always just that the writers of the language specification didn't or couldn't find a way to avoid it. Often, undefined behaviors are intentionally introduced, to make compilers or runtimes faster by not having to handle difficult parsing cases or make expensive runtime guarantees. This has nothing to do with incompleteness and is just a choice made by the language designers.",
        "Not undefined-behavior, BUT definitely: logic's incompleteness shows up in computing as having undecidable problems (like the Halting Problem). It turns out that if somebody tries patching logic by adding extra axioms to make it complete, one can use G\u00f6del's same trick to show that this new logic is still incomplete. Analogously, adding an oracle that can solve (say) the Halting Problem, there are still further sets of problems that are still undecidable. I like to think of the polynomial hierarchy (starting with P, NP, and co-NP) is even kinda the same shadow, when you place a time-bound on the computations; even if you add an oracle to a level, you just have more levels above you. (\u2026Of course, no body knows if P=NP and the hierarchy actually collapses, but I still like the vague analogy.)"

      "output": [
        "I'm not a cryptography nerd, so my thinking on this might be completely wrong, but here goes... Let's say I'm a hacker trying to break the encryption you just described. Like any good hacker, I have your encrypted message and your algorithm, but not your key. I'd start by assuming that there are some 32-byte strings that have an anomalously high (by many orders of magnitude) probability of appearing in the original data aligned at indices that are multiples of 32 bytes. An obvious example would be `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, as many files will have a big block of all 0s somewhere. But I could also construct 32 bytes of standard HTML header or JPG header or whatever; I might have a library of thousands of these anomalously common strings. Now I go through your encrypted message, and at each 32-byte block, I iterate through my 'guesses'. For each guess, I xor that guess with the encrypted block, apply your hash function to the result, xor *that* with the *next* 32-byte block, and perform some straightforward heuristic analysis on the result to see if it looks like meaningful data (of the sort that would follow my latest guess) or random garbage. This attack isn't foolproof, it won't work all the time, and it may not provide the entire original message even when it does get a hit, but it may work often enough to represent a security concern. Let's say you've encrypted 200 photos as JPGs and that each JPG has a standard header 48 bytes long where bytes 16 - 19 represent the image width and height and the others are fixed. (I don't know if JPGs actually have that, but just assume they do; similar patterns do exist for some filetypes, so the concept is solid.) Even if each JPG header starts at a random position in your encrypted message, chances are at least one of the 200 will be aligned with the 32-byte encrypted blocks. I construct, let's say, 300 headers by using the standard 44 bytes and filling in bytes 16 - 19 with typical JPG resolutions like '4096x3072' or whatever. I iterate through your message xorring each encrypted block with each of my 300 guesses. Somewhere around the 42nd JPG (let's say), I get lucky, in that the JPG header aligns with the encrypted block and has bytes 16 - 19 matching one of my 300 guesses. When I hit that guess, I xor it with the encrypted block, hash the result, xor that with the next block, and (uniquely for this guess) notice that the first 16 bytes of the result match bytes 32 - 47 of the standard JPG header, something that has a very low probability of happening by accident. Now I know both the hash value and the original data at that block, *and* I know that I know them, so I can exit my guessing loop and just iterately apply the hash to decrypt the last 159 JPGs out of 200. I still can't decrypt the first 41 JPGs, but clearly I've found more than you wanted me to.",
        "The thing about crypto is that (a) it's easy to build a bad cryptosystem atop solid primitives, and (b) even if the cryptosystem is good, there's often a way to attack the concrete implementation. What you're describing vaguely resembles what's called a stream cypher: Produce a series of cryptographically-secure pseudo-random bits and XOR with that. The concept is perfectly sound if you can guarantee that the particular stream of random bits will never be repeated for different messages. Otherwise, the XOR of the two ciphertexts equals the XOR of two plaintexts, which *is* a weakness. But as others point out, your mechanism for generating bits lacks forward secrecy: If someone can discern the key for a block, they have the rest of the message too. Keep playing with this stuff and you'll start to get a feel for why good cryptographers can get cush government jobs."

I could see a useful plugin with a \"fix with best estimation\" but the problem is back to the intention. Maybe minor things like tabs or semi colons could have an easy fix. The messages you see are a \"best guess\". Back in the day it would just say like, \"failed to parse like 80\" and that was it. Now we can take a good guess as to what is wrong.

It turns out that we've basically reached the point where it's near impossible to create passwords that are easy to remember, but hard for computers to crack. The complexity requirements absolutely do make a huge difference in how long it takes to crack a password. If you have an empty string or just a few characters, then you're right. The password can be cracked almost instantly. Bump that up to your standard 8 character requirement with symbols and numbers, etc, and that time goes up several orders of magnitude, but can probably still be cracked in some reasonable amount of time. 12 characters and it's near impossible. But brute forcing isn't the only method. There's also dictionary attacks, where every word(along with stupid variants like passw0rd, p@ssword, etc) are tried. These can be quite effective if there aren't complexity requirements as you mentioned. Then there's the issue of password reuse. Let's say you create a site and you do everything right. You enforce minimum password lengths and complexity, but another site somewhere gets compromised. And that other site wasn't storing their passwords in a secure manner, or maybe it was leaking them(you'd be surprised the number of times I've found passwords hiding out in log files or other places they shouldn't be). Now those leaked passwords are added to the \"dictionary\" of passwords to try.

So password systems that give so many rules you gotta make up a new password guard against that.",
        "If people were still using md5 or sha it would be right but modern password hashes like bcrypt make it very difficult to brute force them if dumped so the main thing you want is a) an acceptable length because even slow hashes will get brute forced if the password length is 2 b) not one of the most common 50 dictionary words that everyone uses as their password and c) something unique to my site so that if your password does get popped you don't have to change it on every site you use. A lot of the rules beyond length are more performative than anything else though, you are right that a password that has one upper, one lower, one number, one special character blah blah is not meaningfully more secure than X random characters of the same length.

You\u2019ll expand this into learning about memory allocation, compiler development, and operating systems if interested.

Larger scale projects - There\u2019s a thing in education called functional grouping.

Kind of the point of the book was that the gender data gap is invisible because people have long assumed \"human\" and \"male human\" to be equivalent in many data-gathering pursuits. To bridge the gap, then, requires deliberately planning studies to gather more gender-related data, and I think we've not yet done enough on this front within the field. As it stands, you'll still find an unfortunately large population of even undergraduates who will deny that women face discrimination in the field at large, and I suspect that the likelihood of widespread gender-specific data gathering will remain hindered until this is less common."

      "output": [
        "Probably statistically close to 0% if you include all software written. If you actually mean stuff we use every day as in the very highest used apps and most popular websites only - it would be higher but probably less than 50% I\u2019d guess. And that\u2019s not a bad thing - some stuff doesn\u2019t lend itself to unit testing or isn\u2019t worth it, or could be tested better in other ways.",
        "It looks as if you argue that no unit tests is the same as untested. I don't agree on that. There are other ways of testing code. Unit tests are good at finding local bugs but bad at finding larger scale bugs that depend on multiple units and very bad at finding bugs that depend on faulty requirements or faulty implemented requirements. If you only depend on unit test and no more I would argue that the code is unsafe and mostly untested. Unit tests are good but you also need other tests.",
        "A lot of automated tests were written solely to fool automated code coverage testers into the idea that the code is tested. Instead there's a ton of unit test code that is completely useless, time consuming, and adds zero value. It's unfortunate. Unit testing done properly can save a lot of time, effort, and dollars. But your engineers have to buy in, and leadership has to stop measuring code coverage as if it were meaningful.",
        "It depends on what you're counting as \"using\" software. Are you talking about only the software that you have a copy of, or are you counting the services that power websites you visit as well? I can tell you that nearly 100% of the software that Google writes is unit-tested, because programmers aren't allowed to check anything into source control that doesn't have appropriate tests. That is, code that doesn't have tests isn't allowed to officially exist yet. It's a bit of a culture shock for a lot of new developers. *(Google can get away with this because every time you hit \"save\" on a piece of source code, you're creating a persistent version you can always revert back to, so check-in exclusively about making the code officially available rather than backed-up.)* What's more, there are even stricter requirements around integration testing and testing automation if you want to sign up for SRE support for your project (they're the ones who get paged when your service is down, so they care *a lot* about code quality). And launching a public-facing service is nearly impossible without getting SRE buy-in. Most other large tech firms have similar requirements and expectations, though often not quite as strict. Good tests result in faster development speed once a project is more than a few months old (yeah, Google actually A/B tested this, which is the original reason why unit testing was mandatory), so bad practices around unit testing are generally found at (a) really old organizations where the culture is hard to shift, and (b) really small organizations where the appearance of moving fast is more important than measurable results.",
        "Unit tests are really the easy part and most stuff is unit tested. I mean it really depends on what software and companies you're considering, but your typical big companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, etc are absolutely unit testing pretty much any meaningful code submissions But there are other tests like integration tests, automated browser tests, etc that are arguably more important than unit tests, and a lot harder to put together. These are the ones that are neglected almost everywhere",
        "It's hard to know for sure.\u00a0 My gut feel would be something like 50-70% Older projects tend to be less unit tested, and no one will go back and add tests unless the codebase is still being changed frequently.\u00a0 Smaller projects tend to be less unit tested than big projects.\u00a0 Projects in a more mature state have often gone through hardening phases where testing has been expanded.\u00a0 It's entirely possible that some of the big google, microsoft, apple etc projects like chrome etc have coverage rates in the 90s though, so a few projects like that will pull up the average.",
        "Personally, for software my teams and I write, I shoot for about 80% coverage on internal unit tests and as much of the public API surface as is feasible. Getting to 100% is almost impossible and rarely worth the effort. A great example is the dependency injection bits on app startup. Those are notoriously hard to unit test, and realistically, if the app boots and passes the functional/e2e tests, DI was set up correctly"

        "Vulkan is notoriously verbose. This is intentional; the point of things like Vulkan, Metal, and DirectX 12 is to provide more direct access to the graphics hardware, similar to what game developers have had on consoles for a long time. All programmatic APIs provide some degree of complexity hiding. But that simplicity can come at a cost, and in the case of real-time graphics, that cost can matter. It's not 1000+ lines to clear the screen. It's 1000+ lines to set up a Vulkan-based application... that doesn't do anything other than continually clear the screen. One of the reasons that SDL even exists was to reduce the amount of platform-specific boilerplate code needed to create and configure an OpenGL window. Before SDL, it was a pain. It sort of sounds like SDL is now doing the same for Vulkan.",
        "Not a Vulkan expert by any means, but have been playing with it for a little. (I.e. I think I can help at least a bit with this, but you should take my understanding with a fairly hefty pinch of salt!) Pretty much all of testvulkan.c is boilerplate of one form or another. Everything from the start down to line 823 and lines 907 to 1001 are just about setting Vulkan up and shutting it down again, all of which I assume has been taken care of for you in SDL3. Most of the rest is either fairly straightforward or about using barriers and fences. Vulkan requires the application programmer to manage synchronization and memory access conflicts, since this allows finer control and increased performance when correctly optimised than using a generic system under the hood, which is what OpenGL does. A barrier is an object that synchronises memory use, requiring all memory fetches to have completed before memory writes can begin, so if operations are reordered inside Vulkan, you don't suddenly get read and write operations happening in reverse order. A fence is an object used to synchronize the execution of the program with the execution of a command buffer on the graphics card. &#x200B; Inside render, we have: 1014 - 1036: get an image object representing the next frame of the swapchain 1037 - 1046: wait for our command buffer to finish executing if it hasn't finished yet 1047 - 1061: render our frame to the image object (calling rerecordCommandBuffer to do most of the work) 1067 - 1073: present the next frame in the swapchain There's also some boilerplate for making sure the swapchain is valid. &#x200B; In rerecordCommandBuffer, we have: 864 - 879: reinitiailze our command buffer 880 - 885: use a barrier to ensure that all previously dispatched reads from the image memory are completed before executing any subsequent writes. 886 - 891: add the clear command to the command buffer 892 - 897: another barrier on the image memory &#x200B; Some of this complexity is unavoidable, since having to manage memory access synchronization yourself if exactly the tradeoff Vulkan makes for its performance gains, but some of it also comes from reusing the command buffer rather than creating a new one each frame. As I understance it, this is not recommended practice, though I'm happy to be corrected by someone is isn't as much a Vulkan beginner as I am.",
        "Definitely not an experienced C, let alone graphics dev, but the first nearly 200 lines of testvulkan.c seem to be only declarations which in a real world scenario would most likely be pulled in from a header. So that alone feels to me like heavily skewing results. Also obviously I would not trust a competitor (i.e. SDL) to use a library in the best way possible to begin with but rather look for an independent implementation. E: also looking at findPhysicalDevice vs initDevice for example, there seems to be a much more involved error checking/handling (304 to 327) vs a simple null check. Heck in the vulcan test they even broke the SDL_LogError into more lines - be it intentional or not ;)"

Most Node.js frameworks like Express (and now Hono) are extremely lightweight and straightforward and are better for learning IMHO. Node is also great if you are writing UI code since you can stick to one language, if that\u2019s your thing. Node\u2019s concurrency model is also the most unique among these three, and is a major differentiator. There are other, more full-featured frameworks but I haven\u2019t used them. Python, and Django in particular, is a kind of middle ground. Some magic, as it tries to be like Rails, but also a bit more straightforward, since Python tends to have a lot less meta programming than Ruby (and Rails).

No judgment, but it can be a bit mysterious at first, especially if you\u2019re used to a more explicit and/or verbose language.

On the other hand, django and python won't scale well for millions of users, and python is very slow compared to c#. For a smaller thing, like an internal tool, it's fine.

        "Suppose you have a simple electrical circuit. It has a battery and a light bulb. There are two wires, one each from the battery positive and negative poles to the two contacts on the light. The light is on and current is flowing through the circuit. Now you replace one of the wires with a switch (and however many more wires are needed to hook it up). The switch can be on or off, which is one bit of information. The light follows the state of the switch. If you were so inclined, you could call this an \"identity gate\" - it takes one bit (the switch) as input, and returns one bit (the light) as output, passing the input value unchanged to the output. Now let's suppose you put switches on both sides of the circuit. Now you have two bits of input: positive side on/off and negative side on/off. The bulb only lights up when both switches are on. This is an AND gate. You could also wire up the switches on the same side, so that if either one of them (or both) is turned on, the light goes on. This would be an OR gate. Lights in houses are typically wired so that the light turns on when one, but not both, of the switches is on. This allows you to control the light from either side of the room. This is called an exclusive-or or XOR gate: it produces an \"on\" result of one, but not both, of its inputs is \"on.\" In various contexts it's useful to talk about these kinds of on/off states as true/false, 1/0 or other symbols. In particular, if we think of them as 1/0, we can think of a counting system where two switches can encode a number from 0 to 3, three switches from 0 to 7 and so on. We can then do math on this and get interesting results, like Excel. Of course to do this we need billions of switches, but we want to be able to carry these billions of switches in our pockets, so we have developed the ability to build micro-miniaturized switches small enough that if you were shrunk small enough to stand on one, you would be able to see individual atoms. But ultimately, it's all just switches.",
        "Computers are digital or analog. In analog computers, tiny differences in a value are allowed to mean different things, e.g. a voltage of 1.0000000001 volts is meaningfully different from a voltage of 1 volt (or if we used some kind of frequency based sonic computers instead of electrical, a frequency of 100.00001 Hz is meaningfully different from a frequency of 100 Hz), and may cause the final outcome to be different. In a digital computer, the basic values in a circuit (be they voltages, frequencies, the physical positions of mechanical switches, etc) are supposed to only be one of a set number of values, e.g. 0 or 5 volts in a binary digital computer (or -5, 0, and 5 volts in a trinary digital computer). Values that are a tiny bit off (e.g. 0.05 volts) are treated like the same thing as the closest \"allowed\" value, and values that are \"off\" by enough that it's no longer completely clear which value it's supposed to be (e.g. 2.3 volts) are never supposed to happen at all, and if they do the computer will not work right, so the whole system is designed to try really hard to make sure that doesn't happen. There's a lot of reasons why we settled on 2 states. One is that making physical widgets act like they only have a few specific states is hard, because physics isn't that way. No voltage is ever actually exactly 5V. And real physical systems are noisy: you might try to MAKE your device output 5V if a key is pressed and 0V if it isn't pressed, but no matter what you do there will be some extra randomish voltage getting added or subtracted, which makes it harder to avoid errors where something was actually supposed to be \"high\" (5V) but a random voltage drop made it 2.4V and now it's erroneously treated as a logical 0 instead of a 1, and you just accidentally added 4096 votes to some political candidate (that happened once). The more possible states you have, the harder it is to prevent this. This is one of the reasons we use bits and not e.g. trits (which can be 1,0, or a 3rd value that may be called 2 or -1). It's easier to build 2-position switches that reliably don't get caught between positions than 3 (or more) position switches. Logic gates are just physical devices that produce different outputs for different inputs. Many basic logic gates have 2 inputs and one output. One of the important features of logic gates is that they are designed to treat inputs close to the \"correct\" values as equivalent. If you give a logic gate inputs of 0.2V and 4.9V, the output voltage is SUPPOSED to be exactly the same as if you fed it 0V and 5V, or -0.5 and 4V. This is one of the basic jobs of a logic gate: Yes, it does some logical computation, but it also has the responsibility of not allowing minor fluctuations in its inputs to influence what happens next.",
        "I'd actually suggest choosing a different book to start with: [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code], by Charles Petzold. Book choice is personal, to some extent, but I think you'll get more out of Petzold's book than J. Clark Scott's. Petzold's book is widely renowned as explaining things very clearly; it really does start from the very basics (turning a flashlight on and off); it's been professionally proofread and edited; it's so popular that it's gone into a second edition; and it explains some of the questions you ask like *What is a bit?*, *Why do we use them?*, *How do they work?*, and *Why is a gate called a gate?* For a detailed answer to all those questions, I do suggest reading the book, but to briefly answer a couple of them: * A *binary code* is one of the simplest sorts of code we can create, and you can think of a *bit* as being one \"letter\" in that code, that is always one of two alternatives. You could transmit bits to someone by turning a room light on and off; raising and lowering the voltage in a circuit; changing the water level in a pipe to \"full\" or \"empty\"; and innumerable others ways. The exact method we use to signal a bit isn't as important as the fact that there are always two alternatives. * *Why* did we settle on binary codes for computers, as opposed to, say ternary? Actually, we had *already* started using binary codes well before computers were invented, and their advantages were apparent early on. Braille is a form of binary code: it's made up of little 2-by-3 blocks of dots, and each dot can either be *flat* or *raised*. Morse code, too, is (roughly) a form of binary code: individual Morse signals can be either *long* (a \"dash\") or *short* (a \"dot\"). It *is* possible to have codes which aren't binary, but an advantage of binary is that when there are only two possible signals, we can make it *very clear* which one of the two we're transmitting. We could have come up with a version of Braille where, in addition to being \"flat\" or \"raised\", there were, say, 6 intermediate levels between these. But the more \"levels\" we add, the harder they become to distinguish (could *you* tell which of eight levels a Braille dot had, with a finger?), and the more complicated it becomes to make them. * Why are gates called gates? Because they serve a very similar purpose to the real-world gates that people were already familiar with, and which let people, livestock, or water through them (or not). One of the simplest sort of gates is a *relay*: an on or off switch, which we can control with another signal (and even simpler is a [physical switch] (see the link for a picture), which sits in the middle of a circuit \u2013 read the book for more details). Petzold's book shows how, starting with relays, we can build more complicated circuits, the *logic* gates you've mentioned. (Which, contrary to what you stated, do not always have \"two inputs\". One of the simplest logic gates is a NOT gate, which has only one input and one output.) There's a [second edition][code2] of Petzold's book available, if you like \u2013 there's an explanation [here][code2-exp] of what changed between the two \u2013 but personally, I think either is still fine. You might also find interesting [this Hacker News thread][hn] about the book and its second edition: many commenters on the thread say \"Code\" is one of the best books they know of for explaining computers from first principles. [code]: [code2]: [code2-exp]: [hn]: &nbsp; edited to add: [\"Nand to Tetris\"] and its associated book is also good. But I think \"Code\" is very readable, even as a bedside book or a holiday read, whereas \"Nand to Tetris\" is a real course+textbook, and to get the most out of it, you have to treat it like a real course and do all the exercises."

This means that the culture of my company at the right levels is at least trying to support good code quality.

So really, I don't see any need for mongo.",

You can always architect a SQL database to be more like a noSQL database (iirc Reddit's database used to be (still is?) two big SQL tables) and vice versa, but your time is typically better spent using the system that's already built around your data.",
        "So, as the name would imply, I think it's more about not having to write and maintain actual SQL queries/commands. It does feel kind of long-winded and pedantic, and if your application doesn't _need_ a RDB, ACID and/or can tolerate some data loss, it might be tempting to roll out some kind of noSQL solution. Personally, I'd never use a noSQL database as a primary data store or for any mission-critical data, and generally whenever I can't guarantee that the app will _never_ need any of those features/capabilities. However, I have used them as caches, secondaries, for logging and app metrics. Whatever systems you end up using, you'd do well to understand their default configuration and the assumptions/trade-offs they tend to make. When used correctly (and with equivalent-ish configurations) there shouldn't be any _meaningful_ performance differences; neither of them should be embarrassingly sub-optimal, nor should you ever believe they're magic somehow. Edit: All major SQL databases have been able to adequately handle JSON data for some time now, so unstructured data/documents aren't really an issue anymore.",

It's also very easy to operate redis yourself and configure it for durability, whereas with postgres I prefer managed 10 times out of 10. Redis streams are a great companion to kafka, too",

For example, a time series database is excellent at handling large volumes of analytics data. Pretty much any logging or monitoring service will use one of them.

It's like a never-ending single spreadsheet if you imagine timeframe is the row, field is a column. If you want to add more fields (columns in the analogy) you can just do it on the fly and they'll exist from that point on in the timeframe. It's fast, aggregates well. Pretty handy. Edit: elastic and kibana for historics actually, grafana for live graphs.",

In the case of a web app backend, this API would be a service object. I don't write browser-driven tests (except maybe one \"smoke\" test).

        "They used printing terminals. I first learned to program on a 1970s version of this, the [TI Silent 700]. The 1960s printing terminals were bigger and clunkier. The classic one was the ASR-33 Teletype, from which we get the abbreviation \"tty\". These were online systems, meaning you interacted with them by typing commands and seeing immediate results. At the time, it was more typical to use a card punch typewriter to produce a card deck, which you would then give to the computer operators, who would execute it at some point in the next few hours and give you back results as a printout (like, say, a syntax error on your first card). With printing terminals, when you pressed a key, it was both printed locally and also sent to the computer. Output coming from the computer was also printed. But of course the computer cannot remove ink already applied to the paper. So if you meant to type the word \"print\" but hit an m instead of an n, \"prim\" would be permanently on your paper. When you hit backspace, the computer would send \"/m\" to tell you it had backspaced over the m. Then when you started typing again, it would send another slash to show the backspacing was over. So you would see \"prim/m/nt\" on your paper. Some of the older shell commands, like !! to repeat a command, !foo to repeat the last command containing the string \"foo\", \"history\" to print the history, and so on, date back to this era. The \"ed\" editor, still available to this day on many Unix/Linux systems, was designed for these terminals, which is why it is the way it is. As to the question of complete programs, you typically typed them a line at a time, and then used ed-type commands to change them. Or if you were using the BASIC programming language, each line of the program. So you might enter a program by typing each of the following lines: 10 LET A = 1 20 PRINT A 30 LET A = A + 1 40 GOTO 20 Then if you decided you wanted to count by 2s, you could type: 30 LET A = A + 2 This would replace line 30 in its entirety. You could type LIST to see the current state of the whole program, and RUN to run it, and various other commands. If you were using a compiled language, you had to get the complete program into a file (using ed or whatever), then run the compiler, the same as you do now. It was just all a great deal slower than it is today. You had a strong incentive to get good at not making syntax errors, because using the compiler as a syntax checker was really slow - not to mention, compiler design had not progressed to the point of giving particularly useful error messages. Though the pain of a syntax error was immeasurably worse for the punch card users."

E.g. imagine you have some service that simply displays the percentage of users online. If the time to complete that calculation scales linearly with the number of users online, you would initially see very good performance early on. However, as more and more users join, the calculations take longer and longer. Now let's say you have a timeout of, I dunno, 5 seconds due to the protocol you're using for this service. Once this calculation reaches 5 seconds, it will simply fail and never respond. The general concept I just described is algorithm time complexity.",

Daily quests are handed out by a single server. After all, how many people could possibly need a new daily quest at the same time? You slowly let players in, careful not to overwhelm anything, and your launch day goes great. You have over 800,000 players online at the same time and your game is wildly successful with nary a server problem in sight. Exactly 24 hours after the game opens, the first daily reset happens and within the span of 5 minutes 600,000 players try to get their new daily quest. The server goes down, and daily questing is delayed, players are angry. All it takes is missing one little thing when combined with a big launch to make a game crumple. Helldivers 1 peaked at 6.6k players on steam, and the CEO admitted that 50k across all platforms was a wild success. They just had to increase the server capacity to 800k, it\u2019s a miracle that the game was functional at all. My guess is that they needed the first check from value and/or sony to clear to be able to pay for said servers.

That bottleneck can be anything from DB queries, to memory/disk usage or just networking speeds.

If you connect a variable load resistor to the collector circuit you will find that a small change in current moves the collector voltage a large amount (Hence high impedance), doing the same thing to the emitter does not result in much change in emitter voltage (Hence low impedance). For a BJT in the linear region, gm (Device transconductance) is Ic/Vt (Where Vt = -kT/q) = \\~26mV at room temperature (Derived from Ic=Is (e(Vbe/Vt) -1), and the effective emitter resistance is 1/gm, so typically a few tens of ohms or so for most small signal stages. It is instructive to plot the collector current Vs Vbe from the above equation, set Is to 1\\*10\\^-10A or so, it is not particularly critical, anything very small but non zero will do, note how Ic varies with Vbe around the 0.5-0.8V sort of region, also plot the device transconductance. Note that the formula for Ic in terms of Vbe looks a LOT like the formula for Id Vs Vd in a diode! The collector is theoretically a current source, per the above equation, and so looks like a high impedance (Theoretical current sources are infinite impedance). It is interesting to note that many beginners try to use transistors as current amplifiers with defined values for beta, no working engineer does this because beta is effectively a parasitic effect and is hugely variable even between transistors of the same type. Beta is really due to recombination in the base region due and efforts are made to get it as high as possible.

Inclination is a third. There are probably others too but these are the ones I can think of of the top of my head. First thing you need to figure out is, what you mean by monitor. Are we talking cameras? Infrared? Communications? Weather?Because the specific type monitoring will determine what exact orbit you want. For example, spy satellites with optical cameras are typically much lower altitude than communication satellites. In theory, you could monitor the entire planet with a single satellite in polar orbit. You just won't see the entire planet at the same time. You also can't have all 16 satellites is equatorial orbit because you will not see areas farther from the equator. Unless you place your satellites really high up but in this case you will lose a lot of detail on the surface. And you still won't see the poles properly. Start by figuring out your orbits(s) and go from there. Research into the capabilities of satellite monitoring equipment might help you in determining orbits. Look into the iridium satellite constellation. You're gonna need some sort of inclined orbit. But I don't think that putting 16 satellites in the same orbit is the best way.

        "If it's 16 satellites you're probably going to be somewhere between LEO and MEO. There is less of a reason to need many satellites the higher you go because you can see more of the earth. To nail down a more exact answer would require you to map out actual orbits and find out what will give you maximum coverage (see Walker constellation). But for a ball park figure you could take the Iridium satellites (66 satellites at ~800 km with at least one satellite in coverage at all times) and a GPS constellation (~24 satellites at ~20000 km with minimum four in coverage at all times) and do some interpolation to find out what 16 satellites could get you at varying altitudes. If I find myself with some free time tomorrow maybe I'll take a more formal approach at it...

Realistically, the water is going to expand. And if it has to crack your schedule 80 steel pipe to expand, it will. It is better to look at what happens to the container when the expansion occurs. Assume the expansion is an irresistible force of nature. If you put the wax in a balloon and then warm it up (assuming the balloon doesn't pop) the pressure will be not much. But if you put it in a steel pipe and seal it with no airspace, then melt it, it may burst the pipe, just like freezing water would. Truth be told, I do not know how compressible paraffin wax is. So I am not sure if the analogy with water freezing is a good one. But it may be that the reason you can't find any pressure information is because the pressure doesn't matter.

If you\u2019re comfortable with image j, python, and/or opencv that would probably have a more direct solution."

        "It\u2019s the scale. The PCBs are extremely cheap if produced in large scale. The same is for components: cheap if you buy a complete container of them. The assembly is also cheap if everything can be done with one big machine without human work. And these boards are optimized for this type of assembly.",
        "Automation. You can't possibly solder faster (cheaper) than a pick and place + reflow machine. It's surprising how cheap assembly is even for hobbyists now. I have done maybe a dozen designs assembled by JLCPCB now, and as long as you use the parts they have, they can assemble prototypes for you at maybe $20 for a few boards. It scales down very quickly from there. My [largest \"production\" design] so far is 500 boards, with a ESP32, USB-C, and a few bits of supporting circuitry on-board. That came to $4.20 per board, including $3.60 in components (so $0.60 for PCB AND assembly). You can see a cost breakdown on that blog post. 500 is a very small run. If I was making 5000, which is still very small by industry standards, I wouldn't be surprised if you can push it down to maybe $3.80, but that mostly depends on what component prices you can negotiate. Assembly and PCB are REALLY cheap. The RP2040 is about $1 cheaper than the ESP32 by JLC prices (but of course at higher volumes prices are very variable), so even I would be able to build the pico for about $3.20 per board at qty 500, and use a USB-C connector instead of saving cost with Micro-B. Economy of scale will EASILY get you a $5 product that takes $30 to prototype.",
        "Finally a question really at the intersection of my knowledge (business and Econ teacher with a hobby level interest in electronics). Others have already mentioned the details about pick and place and automation, but I just wanted to add that it **really is** economies of scale. There are lots of economies of scale that these producers are benefiting from. It\u2019s not just purchasing economies of scale (bulk buying). There are other internal economies of scale of course like managerial etc, but the real EoS that result in the lower average cost of production are the external economies of scale for them in places like Shenzhen. The technology of the pick and place machines enable automation (then a large portion of the cost of a board is fixed costs like design and set up of the machines, but the average variable costs are very low), but there are other external EoS like the local expertise and know how of the labor force, the low(er) cost of labor / cost of living, the well developed transportation network (subways to get people to factories and shipping ports and other transport hubs to get the chips and products in and out), reliable electricity and tons of local suppliers and customers up and down the supply chain. Add in things like efficient communications (internet and wechat etc) so that someone in Spain can send a file to JLC PCB and get a populated board shipped overnight via airplane in less than 12 hours. It\u2019s really a modern marvel that it\u2019s remotely possible to get a pico for the price we can. There are a lot of issues with the system (literally enough to fill many textbooks), but it\u2019s also really fascinating.",
        "A component that you buy as a hobbyist or prototyper is going through a different supply chain than the one a manufacturer uses. There is a reason price breaks usually happen where a larger package is getting broken down into a smaller one. It really is as simple as scale. Fewer middlemen and less labor makes things much cheaper.",
        "The real answer here is that the RPi is subsidized by the chip maker, and you can't even buy those chips for less than the price of the thing probably. It's a means for them to market themselves to big manufactuerers. And on Ebay a lot of those boards are assembled in China, where labor and parts are incredibly cheap. A lot of the parts are probably recycled too, or fake, or out of spec and stolen. Those talking about economy of scale are talking out their ass. Economy of scale is meaningless when the chip manufacturers don't sell these chips that much cheaper at higher volumes. Even if you bought and assembled 6,000 boards, you ain't assembling an Arduino and selling it for $5 with free shipping because the main chip alone is still $1.26 ea even at that quantity. If by some miracle your BOM and assembly costs did come in at under $5 it would only be just barely leaving no room for profit. Speaking of free shipping, shipping from China is also subsidized because we have agreements in place that we'll deliver packages that arive from there and they don't have to pay the same absurd shipping prices we do in the US to ship stuff locally or to other nations. Once you pay for the parts, the PCB, and the assembly, even if you're having the board manufactured and assembled in China, there's no way you can compete with a $5 Arduino, let alone a $5 RPi with a chip that is WAY more expensive. Now, if you want to assemble the boards by hand yourself... Well then you can cut the cost of assembly out of the equation but I hope you've got a pick and place machine of your own costing tens of thousands of dollars as well as an oven, because you're quickly gonna tire of placing all those tiny components by hand and heating them with a hot air gun or in a skillet or toaster oven! But that may indeed be how some of that assembly is being done in China and is why the boards are so cheap!",
        "Like others have said, machines build them. As an analogy, a stamping machine can pump out car doors every minute, way faster than you can hammer down sheet metal manually. On the actual low cost of the parts though, this continues to be amazing. Ultimately though if you think about it, the cost of the materials keeps going down, as the amount of actual silicon and metal in these things is very low. I guess that relies on us being able to make high-purity materials, and to handle them precisely, and in chemically clean environments, and so on. Nevertheless the scale of this seems to allow the production of low cost parts. From there the assembly is done by machines."

        "There is research that can find anywhere between a 10% gain in fuel efficiency in city traffic, up to a 28% gain in NYC traffic. So it may seem minimal, but it\u2019s not. This start/stop allows manufacturers to increase engine size or leave it the way it is while still meeting stricter and stricter emissions requirements. Without it, engines would have to decrease in size, and make less power. It adds 0 wear to the engine. Cold starts damage the engine, but warm starts do not. Newer oil is designed to cling to the metal in the engine, so that when oil pressure is lost as the engine stops, the surfaces are still lubricated. Running the engine causes more wear than a warm start procedure. As far as the starter and battery go - modern starters very rarely fail. The first few years of introducing start stop (2010ish), there were some cars that did not beef up the starter, but have since corrected course, and most new cars with start stop have a larger starter. You may need a new battery a year or so sooner - after 2 years of using start/stop, the average person saves $300ish, much more than most batteries. If your battery lasts longer than 2 years, the rest is savings. You\u2019ll notice I said most cars have a beefed up starter. The ones that don\u2019t utilize a trick where piston 1 stops at tdc (top dead center), and to restart the car, the injector injects fuel to the combustion chamber and the spark plug fires to start the engine running again. This is becoming much more prevalent. All in all, it\u2019s a net positive. You can turn it off in most cars, and it allows manufacturers to keep a larger engine in the car. The downsides are you might need a new battery sooner, but it\u2019s offset by the money saved while using the system.",
        "I'm terrible about car mechanics so it's really weird this popped up a couple days after I somehow ended up on a tiktok about exactly this. Basically he tested start-stop vs leaving it idling, and the point where start-stop started conserving gas was like.. 7 seconds. After that idling was more wasteful. Also not as likely, but I drive a plugin hybrid so it automatically swaps to ev mode for a few seconds and then drops back into hybrid mode (unless I have plenty of battery left)",
        "what? i've been in a car with such system 12 years ago. first it was in couple of mercedes but some toyota and mazda got it too. even a 10 year old mazda cx5 already has it. although where i live it's very hot and polluted all year round so it makes little to no difference in savings for me because you really need air conditioner. AC will only blow cold for a while before it restarts the engine because the compressor needs the engine running (unlike hybrid or ev where AC is running from battery). definitely a problem if you have 37C/100F ambient temperature. if you live in a cool climate with medium to heavy traffic, this system would definitely save you a lot of gas.",
        "On newer cars it does not do anything bad, because they are designed from the start with those frequent restarting. Mostly. Starters will wear a little quicker, there is no magic, but the engine block itself doesn\u2019t suffer. It did cause problems when manufacturers all started to implement the feature on cars not designed for it. And that\u2019s partly why the system has a bad reputation. Another problem is that the engine turns itself off often st the wrong time, or to be restarted just s few seconds later. And I freaking hate this. So in the end I find a way to deactivate this system for good, and stop my engine manually at red lights and train crossings.",
        "I think you are only just noticing something which has been common for quite a long time. I remember being impressed by may aunt's new car in 2003 or something which had stop-start, I'd never seen it before. My 2013 car has it, I think it was firmly established by that point. Either that or it's a case of US manufacturers not wanting to spend $100 a car implementing something they already did for ages in Europe and which saves consumers $500 a year and a ton of emissions, because that's capitalism for you.",
        "There are so many little things that go into answering your question. There are a lot of answers that point out manufacturers chasing mpg gains, and that is major motivating factor as to why now and not before. I wanted to give some history on the various things that make it more feasible now than before. 1) There is a direct link to start-stop-systems and motorsport. You may be familiar with helical cut gears. Very common in roadcar transmissions. They're quieter and stronger than other gears but create a thrust load along the axle's axis creating power loss, and extra wear. Well, the big brains in motorsport came up with some clever math that allowed them to predict when straight cut gears would be aligned to allow for electronic gear changes and lower power losses through the driveline. The birth of the flappy-paddle gearbox. 2) Direct-Injection engines came onto the scene in a big way over the past 15 years. The fuel injection time on these engines in so short that very precise positions of the camshafts and crankshaft need to be known in order to deliver the fuel at the right time. 3) Combining these two allows the ECU to stop the engine in a position where the minimum amount of rotation is required to start-up. And yes, this something that cars equipped with Start-stop systems do.",
        "I believe what allowed this advancement was the development of oxygen sensors that operate at lower temperatures. Older ones wouldn\u2019t work that well until very hot. So when a car started it would mix the ratio rich thereby creating lots of emissions on startup. If you shut the engine down at a light, then restarted, whatever emission savings you had while off were negated by the burp at startup. Newer oxygen sensors can operate at much lower temperatures, so when you shut off at a light, upon restart the engine knows exactly how much air to add to the cylinder and starts cleanly, lowering the overall emissions by reducing idle. Basically, one start has the same emissions as some period of idling, and now that break even time is shorter.",
        "You basically got it. Emissions regulations have required manufacturers to tune for every bit of efficiency that they can. Also it's a bit of an arms race, as a lot of people heavily consider fuel economy when choosing a car. And yes, there have been some technological improvements that have made it more practical. Particularly in engine controls. It used to take the ECU almost two revolutions of the engine to figure out where in the cycle the engine currently is in order for it to start injecting fuel and firing the spark plugs. A lot of work has been improving that to only 10-20 degrees so it doesn't take as long, there's less unburned fuel going out the exhaust, and there's less stress on the starter. Add to that hybrid powertrains with massive electric motors that can easily rotate the engine much faster than a traditional starter and it almost becomes a no-brainer to stop/start. The main downside now is a lot of vehicles still have an engine driven AC pump so the engine has to cycle on and off to keep the cabin cool but manufacturers are already moving toward electric AC pumps that not only relieve that load but can be speed varied providing more consistent AC performance.",
        "If you notice, the auto engine off feature does not turn on when gas is very low. You would think the feature would be used to the very last drop especially when you are low on gas\u2026.im thinking they are doing this to lower emissions instead. They want to limit your idling not because they want you to save gas\u2026but rather they want you to lower emissions. If gas saving was the primary objective, they would\u2019ve let my engine auto turn off even at low gas level. And also, the engine turn off feature turns off the engine\u2026great\u2026but at the expense of your battery losing a lot more charge every time it requires to turn the engine back on. It also wears at the starter motor\u2026..the companies are trying to cut emissions at the cost of the owner. Wonder why companies are REALLY adding this useless/annoying feature.",
        "The previous version of my car didn't have start/stop, a few years newer model does. It saves a ton of gas. For example, first car I'd be averaging 42mpg, get to a stop light, and watch that average drop back to 41mpg. The light turns green and once I'm back up to speed, I'm now averaging 40.5mpg. Multiply that over a few-hour trip, it keeps your MPG much lower. With my new car, I don't have any loss in mpg sitting at the stoplight, so the gas I use to get back up to speed is FREE. My overall average with this car is significantly better, 17% according to my mileage logs.",
        "a feature known as \"start-stop\" technology, is primarily driven by efforts to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Advances in technology have enabled engines to start and stop quickly and reliably, mitigating wear and tear concerns that previously might have made such frequent starting and stopping impractical. Regulatory pressures and consumer demand for more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient vehicles have also played significant roles. These factors, combined with improvements in battery and starter motor technology, have made it feasible and desirable to implement start-stop systems widely, a development that aligns with broader trends toward sustainability and efficiency in automotive design."

        "Not really at all. The battery on purpose-made EVs is often a \"skate\" that essentially comprises the entire lower portion of the car's structure. It's integrally tied into the heating/cooling system and will often be liquid cooled with pumps sometimes shared with the heat/AC units. This is especially true in Tesla and Ford and a few others with the most advanced heat pumps. Tesla has tied the entire cabin heat/cool, battery heat/cool and motor heat/cool loops together into a single package for efficiency. This gives the batteries absolutely zero shot at being swapped between different types of vehicle. Now a 2018 and a 2022 of the same model.... MAAAAAYBE, but they do change the footprint of the battery as things like suspension and stuff change. For example a Model 3 didn't have this heat pump system in 2018, but it did in 2022, so the batteries between them will be TOTALLY different in their cooling loops, etc. And seeing that the battery's BMS (management system) will be centrally controlled from the computer and be expecting access to the heat pumps, etc to order to operate, it'll be extremely difficult to swap parts around from the \"wrong\" models. Add to that the fact that many of these parts run on CANBUS and those packets are sometimes encrypted using a centrally managed computer (to avoid hacking and other issues), they sometimes need to get \"encryption keys\" to even talk to the car, which may not be possible if it's the wrong kind.",

Both the mechanical aspects of the drive train, as well as the electronics, including stuff like battery temperature management are highly proprietary, unique to each vehicle, and even changing over time within one mode."

        "So, labor wise the headlights call for .4 hours on that vehicle. So maybe $30-40 in labor. That vehicle can either have halogen bulbs or HID bulbs. From the price it looks like it has HID bulbs. Halogen bulbs are super cheap like $10-20 for the bulb. HID bulbs are much more expensive. The OEM HID bulbs are $172 a piece for the bulbs themselves. You can find aftermarket options for cheaper, but they are usually around $60-100 a piece for the bulb. Another fun thing about HID bulbs is they also have a ballast and control module unit, both of which can be hundreds to thousands of dollars to replace. Sounds like your son's Lexus has HID bulbs and yes those bulbs are expensive as fuck and a $300-$500 bill for headlight bulbs is normal for them. Now, they should have known that from the beginning. The bulbs look different with HID bulbs being bright white/blue instead of the normal yellow for halogen bulbs. If the bulbs weren't working they may have just wrongly assumed the vehicle was equipped with halogen bulbs. Regardless, your son would have paid roughly the same price no matter where he went as that doesn't change the price of the bulbs. That said, they should have done a little more research and quoted the job properly to begin with.",

The most important thing is how he would learn and how to move forward if he runs into a similar situation. From what I see here, failure to have a paper trail (like a printed quote with details) is what made misunderstandings happened. If such evidence has existed and Pepboys did something outside of what was agreed, the shop is screwed in small claims.

At the end of the day, if my customer comes into the shop, the only thing I can called off the top of my head is the price of inspection This is what led us to do a free courtesy inspection for all of our customers, so that we can do some preliminary information before giving an estimate Different vehicle systems have different costs, and to say that the cost of a lightbulb is the same across the industry is simply ridiculous There are certain Mercedes vehicles that have four times the price that you quoted for bulb replacement Just try owning a Mercedes ML 350 When I was young, my dad used to tell me promise lesson deliver more . Expecting your service advisor to have a memory recall of every single year make and model, and every single headlight option for every model is asking a little bit too much. But a wise a service service provider will only start work after getting authorization at the very least And hopefully that authorization has some kind of service information backing it up I can definitely see how this can happen in any shop, especially when it gets busy .

I drive spiritedly, my commute allows me to cruise 80mph or so most of the way, 20 minutes either way. I've gone up to 130mph a few times on that plugged tire. Honestly, I'd forget it was even plugged in the first place. Tires still handled well, didn't ever leak air. So I mean, I might just be the best case unicorn scenario when it comes to plugs, but that was my experience. Give it a whirl, see if it works out.",
        "I have used those diy plugs on hundreds of punctures. On cars, trucks, ATVs, lawn tractors, and trailers. If the hole is small enough that a single plug fits tightly, I have never had a failure. The only time it starts to get sketchy is when it is a larger slice where you need to put 2-3 plugs in. But even then, I have had those hold for years.",
        "Copied from one of my other posts, but relevant &#x200B; So tires are one of those things that if they fail they usually result in a catastrophic failure and potentially end up killing someone. Professionally I would never install a plug into a tire because it simply isn't as robust as a patch. Plugs are more designed so that you can limp your vehicle to the tire shop and have them perform a proper repair. Non-professionally I've never heard of a plug failing in a catastrophic way. More often than not the tire just starts leaking again. I don't have any scientific evidence to point at or anything, so maybe it is a nonworry but pretty much from day 1 in my career I've been told to never plug a tire unless it was a temporary fix. My advise would be to just take it to a tire shop and pay the $25 for them to patch it and then you won't have anything to really worry about.",
        "Ive had a plugged tire that lasted until the tread was warn and need replacing. Ive had some tires I plugged and a week later it was flat and the tire was done for. Its still kinda a 50\\\\50 on the actual tire and where\\\\how it was punctured, but a big part of how well it works is prep. A quick and dirty roadside plug is likely to fail. A tire off, using a drill, cleaning, and properly applying can work very well.",
        "I've plugged my front tyre to test the theory which was a little close to the wall. Bought a proper repair kit and noticed the bit that gets wedged in the hole in the tyre is like a really sticky chewing gum but much stronger, add glue and it's pretty solid, well squidgy. It was quite hard to wedge in with the tool and prize it out which shows how tight it was. It sticks out at the bottom of the hole inside the tyre and I left a little extra at the top and applied a blob of glue on top so it's 100% not going anywhere. So the tyre wobbles, stretches as it moves around on the roads so the plug needs to do the same which is why it works so well. If I was doing full on motorways I wouldn't do it but for local and dual carriageways it seems fine and to be honest motorways probably be fine also",
        "Currently have a plug in driver side front tire. It was put in by me, three years ago. Tires are done this season due to tread wear. And the new ones are going on at the start of summer. I drive 60km round trip to and from work on the highway 100kmh daily, plus various city driving. The plug work really well, and they seem to outlast the tire tread."

        "As mentioned below there's better options for this than a thermocouple. But it also sounds like it's what you got and it's a good learning experience. Though you're going to either need another thermocouple and an ice bath (or another always known temperature) or another temperature measuring device. The big things to know about using thermocouples is: A) they need a reference junction as they just give you the difference in temperature vs the reference. B) the voltages are incredibly tiny and you usually need a good amplifier to get a useful signal from them. Here's a good link about the basics:",
        "The curve of a thermocouple voltage to temperature is pretty non-linear. You'll need the formula and then you have to calibrate the reading using something like ice water (which should be 0C). Also, you should avoid soldering thermocouple wire because each wire has a different chemistry specific to converting temperature difference to voltage. Usually screw terminals are the preferred connection method.",
        "Do you understand cold junction compensation? If not, that is the place to start. When I hear you talking about the temp to voltage curve without mentioning cold junction compensation I worry a bit. The temp to voltage conversion has to happen AFTER cold junction compensation. Here is one of the great app notes from the good old days. It is WELL WORTH YOUR TIME to read it. You can skim over some parts, but at least read the beginning. The title is \"Thermocouple Measurment.\" It is 20 pages. It is also known as AN 28 (Linear Technologies Application Note 28). The author is Jim Williams (RIP). Nowadays it is possible with high resolution ADCs and micronctrollers to perform the cold junction compensation in software, however, two conditions must be met. 1) The temperature of the so-called cold junction (which does not need to be cold) must be known. 2) Both of the thermocouple wires must be terminated at the cold junction in such a way that the two wires are kept at the same temperature. Usually this will be the case even with no special effort. But it is worth mentioning. Since thermocouple voltage changes slowly, you need microvolt resolution. So you need a very high resolution ADC. This will probably be an external ADC. Alternatively you can get some type of thermocouple signal conditioner IC or PCB that does all this stuff for you, and provides you with voltage proportional to temperature. It is up to you. But you can't just plug your thermocouple wires into a 12 bit ADC and convert the voltage to temperature. The 12 bit ADC lacks the necessary voltage resolution and does not provide any cold junction compensation. Also, here is a table that shows the type K thermocouple voltages at various temperatures over the full useful range. The table assumes the cold junction is at zero C."

      "output": [
        "Those gate drivers are designed to work with repetitive signals (like PWM), not single pulses. To get the high side mosfet to turn on, the driver needs to generate a power supply voltage higher than your 30V input, since the high side mosfet gate needs to be at a higher voltage than the source pin. To make that happen, while the lower mosfet (section 2 of U8) is turned on, current flows through the diode built in to the driver (U6) from VCC to VB to charge capacitor C7. U6 later uses the energy of C7 to turn on the gate of the upper mosfet (section 1 of U8). So in order to turn on the high side mosfet, you first need to turn on the low side mosfet by making input LIN high for a while (at least some milliseconds; you'll need to measure with an oscilloscope) to charge up the bootstrap capacitor C7, then make LIN low again, then make HIN high for a while and then low again to generate the pulse. That means you'll need separate microcontroller pins for all four inputs (LIN and HIN on U6 and U7) to generate the right pattern. Alternatively, you could design your own driver that uses P channel mosfets on the high side to avoid needing bootstrap voltage in the first place. You may also find those mosfets have too high of an on resistance (0.335 ohms at 4.5V gate voltage) depending on the resistance on the coil. Make sure the mosfet resistance is a lot less than the coil resistance."

Normalizing the groups to the starting data point would give you the utm of each layer, assuming the layers failed individually.

        "Without having your vehicle in front of me I am spitballing all of this so take it with a grain of salt. Especially with suspension components on old vehicles rust buildup may inflate these labor times because the mechanics will need to spend longer removing the old parts. It also looks like there might be different suspension packages for the Rav4 so it depends on which one you have. Labor times Front Struts - 2.8 hours Rear struts - .9 hours Sway bar links - .6 hours (there is a lot of overlap with the struts here so they may or may not charge you labor on this, we'd cut it down to .3) Total Labor - 4 hoursish. I work at a higher cost of living area and our suspension labor rate is $160 an hour on most vehicles so $640ish for labor costs. Alignment is a flat charge of $119.99 Parts costs Front struts - We usually get complete strut assemblies so it will make a difference whether they are piecemealing them or using complete assemblies. But it looks like MSRP for front strut assemblies is $376.59. Keep in mind that MSRP isn't actually retail price and we would most likely mark it up to around $460 per strut. Rear Shocks - I'm a bit less confident on them as they have springs listed which might mean it has some weird load-leveling suspension or something like that. From what I can see the Rear shocks MSRP is $124.03, again with markup we'd be around $230 per shock. &#x200B; Hopefully that helps with some perspective. &#x200B; As far as the rear differential. It depends on where the leak is coming from. Some of them have a seal where the axle tubes go into the differential case. Those seals are generally not serviceable because those tubes are pressed into the assembly at the factory and to remove them you'd essentially need industrial machining equipment which would obviously outstrip the price of replacing the differential. But, those seals aren't the only place it can leak from and all the other seals are usually serviceable."

Those kinds of engines are notoriously finicky, have tight tolerances, oil management is more difficult, maintenance hours were a nightmare. The RX7 is the commonly mentioned car that had a Wankel Rotary. And when it ran well, it ran *great*. When it misbehaved, it was awful.",
        "Same reason there isn't rotary powered anything else. They're not very efficient, they aren't very reliable or long lasting either Generators need to be reliable, efficient, and inexpensive, in roughly that order. A standard single cylinder motor ticks those boxes nicely. Mazda is apparently going to use a wankel in an ev range extender, if anyone can make it work well it's those guys and i wish them luck.",
        "Noise is high. Wankel engines are known for having high exhaust temperature, and with that comes high pressure when the exhaust port opens, and with that comes noise. They're also inefficient (difficult to seal the combustion chamber due to the geometry, high surface area for heat transfer losses, poor combustion chamber shape) and more expensive (not mass produced in the numbers required for low cost). Cost is the biggest factor to answer your question. Vibration is low, but it's not low enough to compete with batteries/electric motors, because there are still torque pulses that need to get reacted, even if there is no reciprocating weight.   Rotary engines are good for applications that don't care about efficiency, don't care about cost, and are going for maximum power density. Or where novelty is a benefit. Think racecars, military drones, not much else.",
        "Fuel economy and reliability are very important for a portable generator. Also, rotaries don't make much torque (especially at low RPM), which is important for a generator. And they burn oil. And the heat is very unevenly distributed, which makes air cooling harder. And customers are less familiar with them. And they'd be harder to find spare parts for. And customers don't like rebuilding engines with new apex seals, compared to piston rings that last the lifetime of the product. And it's easy to flood the engine with fuel when starting/stopping. And they're not much smaller when compared to a single cylinder air cooled piston engine. And they would weigh more, because the engine would probably have to be made from steel rather than aluminum. And that's just off the top of my head, there are probably more reasons."

A small variant in your design. Get a fountain pump, timer, pelican case(or something heavy duty and water proof and floaty), either a power cord to shore or a battery in the floaty case, and an anchor to keep it in location. This would be the simplest idea that I would use. Though if you want the WOOSH noise then yeah a scuba tank with something like a regulator and a sprinkler valve would work too. To keep it invisible, anchor it a few feet underwater and I would run a pvc pipe up closer to the surface and spray paint it black or green to match the water. The water would fill the pipe between bursts allowing you to shoot water and air and keep your main hardware from being seen. I have no idea how to make the whale shape however, you\u2019d need stuff like water proof motors, pulleys, anchors and the whole thing gets exponentially more complicated.

You'll probably have a packaging engineer as well (which is what I do) who works with marketing to ensure the design fits their needs, conducts any testing to ensure the bottle is the right size, makes it to the consumer without damage and does what is supposed to do (dispense the right amount of soap and lasts though enough pump cycles). I might even work with a testing facility where another engineer designs and builds a fixture to continuously cycle the pump to see how long it'll last. Finally I'd work with a plant or project engineer to have equipment made or modified to unpack, orient, fill, cap, label, and box the bottles of soap. The plant engineer might work with other outside equipment companies to design or modify equipment to do this work. It's also the packaging engineer's job to design the label (where I'll work with a label company with their own engineers). If the bottle material is unique or has any weird requirement like it'll be used exclusively in cold environments the label company will work with a material or chemical engineer to spec an adhesive to make sure the label stays on the bottle. The packaging engineer's will spec a box (where again there will be engineers from the corrugated company) and design the pallet stacking pattern (which might be stacked by robots, who's companies have their own engineers).",
        "I actually work at a company that deals with this kind of stuff and you'd be surprised by how much goes into designing a simple thing like a plastic bottle. There's tons of design iteration, FEA simulations, prototypes, tolerance investigation (weeks of back and forth arguing over 0.05 mm). It's mostly industrial designers and mechanical engineers doing the work for the design and then obviously you'll have more people down the line to actually manufacture the thing.",
        "Depends how deep you go. The engineers that designed the bottle The engineers that designed the factory that makes the bottle The engineers that designed the equipment that goes in the factory The engineers that designed the factory that makes the equipment. And then you can take this however many layers deeper you want of who made the equipment that made the equipment. The engineers who designed the cars that all those other engineers use to get to work to do their jobs. The engineers who designed the oil refineries not only to produce the plastic for the bottle but the gas for the engineers cars to get to their jobs.",
        "Mechanical Engineer: Design and maintenance of the tooling. Mechatronic Engineer: Automation of the process and maintenance of the tooling. Industrial Engineer: Process Optimization, Quality Control and Plant Operations. The design of the bottle is not necessarily made by an engineer, it can be an Industrial Designer. The logistics, branding and packaging can be done by non-engineers. Edit: This answer can change based on whether we are manufacturing one plastic bottle or mass production. If it's just for one bottle, then most of these engineers here are unemployed."

It depends on the refrigerant, flow rates required and pipe size/lengths. Refrigerants are sensitive to difference in temperature on hot/cold sides. So cold ice cream on one side vs summer heat on the other night be worse (less efficient, harder to reach correct temp) than what you currently have, depending on which refrigerant it uses. We would need much more information about the machine and the setup. Especially with something that affects bacteria/fungus growth in food.

Remove the condenser section and pipe/wire it to operate outside of the space. This is not an ideal solution. This may alter the way the unit operates, and the condenser section is probably not rated for outdoor use. 2. Install a ductless wall mount AC with a condenser outside.

Honestly I haven\u2019t used Falstad ckt sim too much, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these are \u201cideal voltmeters\u201d, meaning their input impedance is infinite.. i.e. no current will flow into them, because it looks like an open (nothing is connected for current to flow). In the real world, a voltmeter doesn\u2019t have infinite impedance. Generally meters will have 10MegOhms. This is a relatively large value, and therefore only a very little current, but certainly non-zero, will flow into the meter, and the voltage across this resistor is measured and displayed. Likewise, ammeter will yield the opposite result. In order to measure the current, an ideal meter will look as if it is a short ckt, and therefore will have no voltage drop. In reality, once again this is not the case. But in your ckt, you are essentially providing a zero input impedance branch to your ckt. Therefore, all of the current will choose to go through the \u201cdirect wire (short ckt)\u201d back to ground, and none will flow through the zener. Therefore no voltage drop will occur across the diode, as you essentially connected the resistor directly to ground.",
        "The ammeter acts like a short that measures current across it. Said short is, of course, zero ohms, which is much lower than the zener's non-zero ohms, so basically all of the current goes through the ammeter instead of the zener. What you need to do is limit the current with a resistor in series with the ammeter itself, so the zener has a chance to actually do anything."

On the order of say 1/8\u201d or thereabouts, though say even as low as say 1/64\u201d Now a scalpel on the other hand has a cutting edge that is not quite atomically sharp. A sharp scalpel is maybe a couple microns across at the tip. [see this article for SEM images of blade edges] But it is possible to make atomically sharp blades from obsidian flakes or diamond flakes or through the application of mems techniques to silicon wafers. At the very least atomically sharp needles are commonplace in scanning tunneling microscopy",
        "I'd say it's more specific. My doorstop is a wedge, and quite efficient, but I wouldn't describe it as sharp. Cutting effectiveness isn't an effective description either. My oxy acetylene torch is quite effective at cutting, but I wouldn't describe it as sharp. And cutting tools used in machines for some materials could easily be described as dull, because even though they cut their respective material effectively you'd have a hard time cutting your finger on one. Sharpness doesn't have a precise technical definition, IMO. In general, it is a thin, hard, wedged shape material, most often a tool. But it will vary with context.",
        "Well on the a small scale, when you cut something, you are separating the molecules, and the \"sharper\" the wedge is the more effective it will be and less force will be needed to seperate those molecules. Think of the molecules like a big ball pit and all the balls are stuck together, the smaller the tip of the wedge is the more effective it will be at seperating the balls. Blade angle can be put on a graph, where the thinner the blade the easier it will cut, the thicker the wedge/blade the longer that blade will last and the more durable the blade is. So, finding the sweet spot will be determined by the application. Dcaples, for example, are often a disposable because they prioritize sharpness over durability."

We set CoF\u00d7mg=ma, m cancels and a=CoF \u00d7 g. The acceleration in g will be the same as the coefficient of friction. Dragsters spin their wheels to heat up and melt the tires to make them stickier, increasing the CoF. We can also add more normal force with spoilers or fans. But why do we make cars lighter if the mass term cancels? Because power = force \u00d7 speed. For an ideal power source we have all the force we could want at low speed. We call this situation 'traction limited,' meaning the vehicle could produce more power but the tires would slip. As we go faster we can't produce as much force. There will be a certain speed at which the vehicle can't produce the force required for max acceleration. We call this situation 'power limited,' meaning the tires could handle more force but the vehicle can't produce it. A lighter car has less grip but also needs less force to accelerate. If we reduce the mass of the vehicle we can sustain that max acceleration up to a higher speed and thus reach that speed sooner. If you have a large enough power source or a short enough track where you're always traction limited then the mass of the vehicle doesn't matter. This is all for a straight track in a 4wd vehicle with perfect suspension ofc.",

For example at launch there's a momentary delay in the delivery because the tire will actually wrap up almost around the rim and if the car was to full send it in that moment, it will snap the rim or shread the tire. From that moment forward its a matter of laying power to the maximum level of the downforce available which can be measured in thousands of pounds. To even drag the wing on a top fuel through the air at over 300mph takes over 500hp to do..

I will list them anyway. Reduce TX power of sensors 1. reduce TX power of sensors 2. change sensor frequency 3. Change radiation pattern of sensors 4. change VR peripheral frequency 5. Increase VR peripheral TX power 6. Change radiation pattern of peripherals 7. Screen sensors (wire mesh would work too, not only foil... think about the window of a microwave oven). 8. Turn off sensors. That is all I have. I realize none of it is going to help you. Maybe there could be some other creative ways to screen out the sensors. With unobtrusive shielding. Metallic carpet. Wire mesh. Conductive paint. Carbon fiber wall hangings. When I worked for a radar company we had these foam pieces we could use to absorb radiation. They were pointy and loaded with carbon black. Not something I would want in a VR room. But they do block radiation very effectively. Good luck!",
        "Have you located all the transmitters? If you haven't you should do that instead of trying to create a Faraday shielded room. 2.4 gHz is mostly line-of-sight and what you should try and do is create a \"shadow area\" for your gaming room. Imagine a flashlight from the sensor position pointing into your room. Now get a book or a magazine and move it closer and closer to the \"flashlight\" until the entire flashlight beam is blocked from \"shining into\" your room. The best way is to use metal reflectors near or next to the transmitters in-line with the area you want to \"shadow\". The closer to the transmitter the larger the shadowed area you'll create. You can verify this by watching the RF signal dip when you put the metal reflector in front ot the transmitter. Good luck.",
        "If the sensors are not meant to transmitting in 2.4 you could try to start to solve that. Pull them apart or maybe get a sniffer and find out what\u2019s transmitting, a bit of fiddling and you might get the spurious frequency to shift or disappear. If they are designed to transmit in 2.4 they still shouldn\u2019t interfere with other Wi-Fi devices. Are you in the US and are both your devices FCC compliant? Look for little logos on them? If they are they should be tested to avoid exactly this kind of interference and is there is still interference then there\u2019s a potential your devices are non-compliant and you can complain the manufacturer/supplier and even the FCC but that won\u2019t solve your problem right now.",
        "A few things here: 1. 2.4GHz signals travel a long ways. Based on all these sensors you have in your house, I'd say you've inundated the frequency space and your throughput is going to suffer. If they can connect to 5GHz, move them to that. 2. Are you seeing other 2.4GHz WiFi networks? If so, you are getting interference from outside the house. 3. Even if you don't see other 2.4GHz WiFi networks, lots of other devices use them (even those that aren't WiFi).  4. Under ideal conditions, max 2.4 Ghz throughput is 600Mbps. This is like inside a Faraday cage with a perfect AP and a few feet between it and the client. Based on your issues, I'd assume you maybe seeing like 50-100Mbps. Only solution I see is to change out your VR stuff (Are these some special legacy accessories that only come in 2.4GHz? I feel like anything even slightly modern would have 5GHz.)\u00a0for something that supports 5GHz and add an AP in the room. If you don't want to do that, adding an AP in your room could yield some positive results. 2.4GHz is an incredibly busy space and you should really try to avoid it if you can.",

        "You can use the ideal gas law to calculate the mass of air in the tank at both 125 psi and 90 psi, then the difference in mass of air is the mass that can be removed from the tank when it drops from 125 to 90 psi. Then, you'd convert the 6cfm at 90 psi to a mass flow rate. The mass to reduce from 125 to 90 psi divided by the mass flow rate would give you a time. I'm not sure if the 6cfm is in standard cubic feet per minute or if it's based on the pressure that you're flowing at, so you'd want to check that. Edit: I think that the CFM quoted for air tools is always standard cubic feet per minute (air at standard temperature and pressure). The result of this is that the time will only depend on the CFM, tank size, initial and final pressures. It won't depend on the 90psi that you're flowing at. Edit 2: here's a quick equation: t = V(P1-P2)/(14.7CFM) Where: t = time in minutes V = tank volume in ft^3 P1 = initial pressure in psi P2 = final pressure in psi CFM = flow rate in standard cubic ft per minute"

Try to put both together as a sum of the change going into the output node and see if you can see which things cancel out + post back with progress if that doesn't help! Conceptually, this might also help: you are looking for the _change_ as a result of the excitation, so constant terms will fall out (ala, the derivative of a constant in calculus). Crudely stated, if one node goes from 1V to 5V and another goes from 2V to 6V in the same amount if time, they have the same delta, even though the have different voltages at any given point in time. (Hint: also, take note of the phase relationship between `e1` and `e2`). **Edit**: actually, if you did the first part, you should already have an expression for the steady state with the CS1/2 caps acting as a voltage divider for the e1/e2 signals. If so, you should be able to sum the excitation function with your steady state function to get the node voltage as a function of time. From there, you should be able to get the change as a result of the excitation magnitude + take the derivative to get the change due to acceleration. P.S.

[from /r/cardesign the other day] [from /r/photography] [from /r/therapy] Those are just three examples off the top of my head from my own feed. If use of this stuff had matured to the point of being a mundane part of everyday activity in whatever field, the questions would look different. Nowhere in any of those subs do the questions sound like \"what stages of car design are best served by AI?\", or \"are there differential outcomes between a person seeking therapy from an AI versus a human?\" - with one notable exception, that therapists do sometimes use AI-assisted writing to sketch out notes and are frequently asking each other about HIPAA implications of it. Outside of that, you'll know when it gets there because the pressing questions people are asking will be more specific like that and not a constant flood of \"what do you think, is it going to destroy X/Y/Z field/make us obsolete as humans/make the wrong choice in the trolley problem?\"",
        "I've been working in large scale ML (mostly doing work related to click prediction) for about 15 years, so it doesn't seem \"new\" to me. Even DNNs have been around for some time, and some DNN architectures like LSTMs have been around and doing clearly useful thing for several years. That said, the last 2ish years I think things are shifting, and it's mostly because of two reasons: 1. the release of generative pre-trained transformers to the world, at a time when hobbyists can afford to buy machines that are at least capable of generating inferences using these models relatively quickly (and we're also seeing new techniques for fine tuning them such as LoRA). My mental model had been \"the scale necessary to do worthwhile things with DNNs puts them outside the reach of most, so they're really only a tech relevant to big data companies\" but that's really no longer true in the era for GPTs. Training a worthwhile model from scratch is still outside the reach of most, but you don't need to train a GPT to use one. 2. While prediction models aren't new, the quality of the current prediction models that people can download and run locally (or in the cloud) enable people to do things that go far beyond human predictive capabilities. What to an algorithm is \"just\" a prediction, to a human is more. Prediction of text is nothing new: phones have been doing that for a long time. . have For example the LLMs are predicting tokens and by itself token prediction is not a new task: your phone's keyboard has been predicting tokens for some time. But now we are seeing model performance at token prediction where you can predict a transcript between a user and a \"helpful assistant,\" and you can use that to build a chatbot and suddenly you are having the experience of chatting as some silicon is doing tons of math on matrices to predict the chat. Or to consider text to image models such as stable diffusion - at an extremely high level, they're just doing image prediction. But the result is the ability to generate incredible images. Image prediction is enabling people to generate art. We are in the process of learning/discovering things you can do with prediction models.",

        "No, but mainly because the underlying techniques go back decades. None of this just popped up out of nowhere, contrary to the hype. There are two factors that have changed, but neither is mind shattering. First is that the technology has scaled enough to allow for emergent applications (like \"universal\" face recognition and generative modeling based on existing samples) that the general population thought would be science fiction for the foreseeable future. Who and exactly how were unknowns until recently, but the outcome was pretty well guaranteed to happen at some point fairly soon. The second, even more easily predictable accelerant is venture capital and marketing being funded at insane levels to speed the emergence of AI. We could have had the necessary public discussions on ethics, regulation, and access fifteen years ago. Academics and some of the commercial application developers had been already since the late 80s and early 90s. It was even more decades before if you count the wide array of popular science fiction highlighting issues that are now part of our everyday life. It's been bizarre and even perverse to watch swaths of society become less and less engaged while attention and involvement become more and more important. None of this should be a mystery to the degree it has become. If nothing else, at least AI will reach the point where anyone that committed to being checked out can just plug in and let AI live for them. That's about as commercial as it can get."

The center vertical beam has the same stresses on it, compression in the top and tension in the bottom. Roughly at the center line is the neutral axis where in theory there is no stress in either direction. The vertical center plate is mainly there to keep the horizontal plates in position relative to each other, while the horizontal plates hold the majority of the stress. I cant remember the equation off the top of my head, but it is exponentially increasing with the distance from the neutral axis. This is why airplane wing sections typically have holes in the center plates of their struts; that part of the strut has little to no stress in it. Orienting the beam in the H position would put very little material away from the neutral axis, which would result in the beam failing at a much lower load.

Experience is the only thing that answers those questions, and if you don't have someone in house who knows how to handle those things, then you are going to be spending a LOT of time on figuring it out and verifying it with testing. This is why the giant engineering organizations hold the positions they do: they've had in some cases several decades to build up the bespoke knowledge they have of their products. It's not impossible to compete with a company that's been doing something for decades, but you really need to budget a lot more man hours into research and testing than sales people usually think.

The differential is probably causing more loss because of the design. A typical EV only has a reduction gear so it is probably about half of an ICE car so 1-3%. This is just a rough estimate. It would be beneficial to not have a reduction gear but not that much. The efficiency loss in the motor and the electronics are both higher but the biggest loss is in the battery."

Depending on the brand and how old the loadcenter is, this could be a simple job of swapping out 20 amp breakers for 30 amp, or an expensive job of replacing the panel if your panel is old and dangerous (Federal Pacific, Zinsco). Swapping breakers can be pretty easy. There are youtube videos on it. Be sure to use the same brand and model, be sure to turn off the main breaker, be sure to tighten the wires securely."

        "In a former job I did thermal cycle testing of automotive electronics. Most of it was cycling between -40C to +125C (257F) and up to 150C (302F) for engine mounted electronics. These were 1 hour cycles. We expected at least 1000 cycles and it wasn't uncommon to have no failures at 3000 cycles. Edit: Forgot to mention that the failures weren't directly from the heat. Most failures were in the solder joints due to fatigue from the CTE mismatch between the component and the substrate. The effect of repeated cold/heat cycles is kind of like bending a paperclip back and forth a bunch of times.",
        "None of the materials that computers are made out of really have properties that significantly change if they exceed that temperature. I\u2019m not sure about all of the components but computer CPU\u2019s can typically endure temperatures of up to 80 \u00b0C (~175ish \u00b0F) for long periods of time without being damaged",
        "Some automotive grade components are spec'd to 150C, especially when used in the engine compartment. Commercial components are rated to 60C for comparison. There are also temperature grades at 85C and 120C. But this is individual components, not the overall module. Each component will heat up a little higher than the case it is in, so there is a lot of engineering to work out the temperature of each component when the case it at (say) 70C inside the car.",
        "The tl;dr is: lots of engineering manhours across all the OEMs and suppliers in the industry to spec, design, and validate every component small to large against the kind of extreme use cases that the average user will never see nor care about. But the longer answer is that you've hit on such an interesting topic around automotive vs consumer electronics. Especially in the 2010s when multi touch displays were everywhere in consumer electronics there was a lot of WTFing from the general population about why automotive UI felt so laggy and behind. But your question is exactly why: it has to work after an all-night -40 deg F cold soak. It has to work in 115 deg F heat (and actually hotter since a car sitting in the sun can get up to over 140 deg F). It has to sustain high vibration environments, and work reliably for hundreds of thousands of miles. Your car's UI not working would be annoying if they were only used for entertainment but most cars have safety and function critical features accessible from the infotainment so now they *really* have to work. But don't forget all the other computers in the car! The control systems have computers mounted all over: engine bay, exterior, in the rain and the salt and snow. You can start to see why automotive computation seems \"behind\" compared to other electronics; the certification and validation is time-consuming and expensive. Once you have a chip or board or component that you know will work in all environments for the life of the car you *really* don't want to change it unless you have to. There was a headline a few years ago about Tesla's electronics being \"six years ahead of Toyota\". Hopefully this sheds some light on why, also because Toyota's strategy for maintaining high reliability numbers is being very conservative about moving to new technology or components. One of the specifications for this is [AEC]. Everything from microcontrollers down to random ICs and passive components can be had with AEC ratings. But it's actually not hard to get silicon to withstand that heat, the difficulties are the everything else around them: connectors, housings, peripherals, etc. Vibration control is also huge in automotive elctronics design. Something like a FET hanging off a board in the wrong orientation with no vibration damping will eventually fatigue and break off. Most automotive computers are in [ruggedized aluminum housings] with a lot of potting internally. The specifications and processes for the connectors in your wiring harness are also intense, with very specific crimping forces defined to ensure high reliability.",
        "They're speced out for 85C / 185F ambient temperatures. I design for something like this, and we run them in the temperature chamber for a week at 85C while power cycling them, and monitor the J1939 signal for dropouts. I'll also run the thermo calcs on the heat-facing components to find the ambient limits before I put the board together. If it's not at least 85C, I just can't make it like that.",
        "115F should not be a problem for electronics. These devices see temperatures as high as 400C during production. The manufacturer then decides based upon the application how to package the part. Many today are packaged in plastic which would not like 300C. Once packaging is decided life testing is performed to determine how long the component will last at max operating temperature. One must be careful not to accelerate the temperature so much as to kill the part in a mode that would not occur under normal operation conditions. Based upon the results of the life testing a spec is written for the device. As one can imagen it cost more to eliminate the plastic and organic components to produce a product that can survive higher temperatures. For example plastic will outgas in space and should not be used in that application. Also there is no air in space so one must rely on conduction alone to keep the device cool. For auto, the temperatures seen in a car in the desert should not present a limit unless inappropriate materials are chosen for the packaging or adhesive application.",
        "The temperature limit of most electronics has to do with solder and substrate materials. Very high current circuit boards like lasers have ceramic substrates and ceramic semi-conductors that are rated to thousands of degrees F. It's all about what materials you use and how big a heat sync you want to put on your chip.",
        "When you are building custom electronics and want it be really durable you get automotive rated components. They are mostly tech that is 30 years out of date, but are tough and have well understood failure modes. Also keep in mind your cars \"computer\" generates a tiny fraction of the heat of a gaming PC, so it doesn't get way hotter than that 115.",
        "When I first started in industry 20 years ago, the automotive standard for everything we sold to the OEMs that made electronics for the auto companies had to pass -50 to 150\u00b0C thermal shock and 150\u00b0C iso conditions for 1000 hours. Then it became 2000 hours. Now we need to pass that while simultaneously doing shock and vibe testing. So basically, that's why, they're built around handling harsh conditions. 115\u00b0F is nothing. When we sell the same stuff to the PC component manufacturers the specs are way lower. I'm not throwing shade at the consumer PC components, they're also generally performing at a much higher computing level than the hardware that's making sure you engine doesn't knock."

If you must use a compressed gas, argon should pack denser than C02, but it's much more expensive to source, and obviously you aren't getting around the steel container.

Maybe something along those lines would work? Primers have very little compound in them, but I would think the gas volume produced would be enough to rapidly inflate a bladder to bursting if you play with size enough.

All are possibilities. As for your second engagement... Sounds like the launched at or near maximum range, the bogie realized he'd been launched on, the bogie turned tail... And shocker, the missile didn't hit the bogie as he was beyond max range by the time the missile got there. I mean, if max range is 120 nmi and the *average* velocity (not peak!) velocity of the missile is a bit over Mach 2, then it's going to take about *6 minutes* for the missile to get there. If it takes the bogie 30 seconds to hang a U-turn and he's doing Mach 0.9... That's and extra 40 nm that you're tacking on to the engagement range.

What is the geometry of the lifted item? Will it be a stable lift? How many slings will there be? * What is the acceleration of the grounded item (and how much equivalent force is there on the lug?) * Will there be off-vertical hoisting creating in-plane or out-of-plane moments and stress multiplication on the weld group? * What is the global stress in the parent structure? * Is the global structure stable?",

Failing that, you can look at cross sectional area and total volume of the weld vs. tensile strength of your material in the as-welded condition to give you a maximum failure load in tension. With that number I would strongly advise you design a very large factor of safety, given that you have failed to use the correct formulas and the weld will not be exclusively loaded in static tension. Additionally, be extremely careful to ascertain the composition of the base material of both your components. Welding something with high carbon/carbon equivalent can cause significant embrittlement if you do it improperly, which will lead to catastrophic failure.

        "Disclaimer: this is nowhere near my field, but since diesels have had direct injection and turbocharging since forever I would guess there are not a lot of gains to be had here. Both timing and mixture are well controlled in modern diesels based on when and how much fuel you inject. Trying to achieve this with variable compression seems like it would add a lot of failure points and new design complexity without adding a lot of efficiency over what we already have today. I would also guess that since diesel's *are* compression ignition there is a hard limit on how much you can change compression ratio and still have the thing actually work."

You will need to know hardware and techniques that minimize space, weight and cost. If you have strong electronics backgrounds. You will be required to do some electronics procurement as well and maybe some PCB design. To get started, you can familiarize yourself with SolidWorks or autocad. SolidWorks seems to more popular though. As well as PCB design software, you can get KidCad for free However, I would strongly recommend doing some Arduino projects before jumping into PCB design.

While that's the ratio that gets you the most complete combustion, there are advantages in power, knock suppression, heat management etc in running quite a bit richer at full power.

This mode is the easiest to look at, but won\u2019t update if the waveform changes. You have to press run, then wait for a trigger for it to update. Normal: This acquires a new waveform every time the trigger occurs. This is nice because it auto-updates, but may be less clear if the trigger occurs multiple times in the waveform. You can pause the updates by pressing stop. None: just acquires data at random times without a trigger. Good if you don\u2019t know what you are looking for, yet. Auto: Automatically switches between none and normal. Initially, this will be none until there is a trigger. When there is a trigger, switches to normal (paused) for a few seconds, then back to none. This is a good mode for setting up the actual triggers because you can see the waveform and see how it\u2019s triggering. Here is what you might do. Switch to none and adjust time/div and volts/div so you have about two periods of the waveform on the display. This is a bit of guesswork at this point. Switch to auto and set up the trigger. You want to always trigger at the same part of the waveform. Switch to single and adjust the time/div and volts/div again. Since you have a good trigger, this will be much more clear than the previous adjustment. Switch to normal and begin studying the waveform, possibly making changes to the circuit to see how the waveform changes. The trigger can be set to occur only on the rising edge, or falling edge. They can be set to channel A, B, or an external signal. Each channel can be set to AC or DC. AC will remove the DC bias from the signal so that the average is always 0 V. I think DC is easier to understand, but AC makes it easier to zoom in on a signal that has a DC bias.",
        "For the wiring, you have the B channel wired correctly. The A channel should also have the ground connection. This won\u2019t matter for low frequency signals because the A-ground is connected to the B-ground inside the oscilloscope (and usually connected to mains ground!). You need to have at least one ground connection somewhere for low frequency. For high frequency, the probe wire will act as an antenna and pick up lots of noise from the environment. To avoid this, the probe is a coaxial cable grounded at both ends. You connect one end to a ground on the circuit you are testing. The simulator probably doesn\u2019t simulate this environmental EM, so will be more tolerant if this ground connection is missing."

It should be about as big as the drum to start. The motor pulley can be like 50 or 75 mm in diameter (but be prepared to change it). You can play with the pulley size ratio to get the speed you need. If the motor turns out to be under-powered, you can get a bigger one. I can't imagine you need more than 750 Watts.

The microwaves are absorbed by your bowl, so the heat does not directly go into your soup. In essence, your soup is in the \"shadow\" of your bowl, mostly.",
        "Ceramic bowls heat up in the microwave due to a process called dielectric heating. Dielectric heating occurs when an electric field oscillates rapidly, causing polar molecules within a substance to align with the field. In the case of a microwave oven, the electric field is generated by the microwave radiation.  Although ceramic materials themselves are typically non-polar, they contain small amounts of water or other polar molecules trapped within their structure or absorbed on their surface. When these polar molecules are subjected to the oscillating electric field of the microwaves, they try to align themselves with the field. This rapid realignment of polar molecules generates heat within the ceramic material.  So, while the ceramic material itself might not contain as much water as the food or liquid being heated, the presence of even small amounts of polar molecules is sufficient to cause dielectric heating and thus heat up the ceramic bowl in the microwave.",
        "Also the microwave will heat 6mm deep of liquid or so. So the surface water next to the bowl is likely going to be hot but the rest very cold. Hence you should heat at 50% for twice the time (or whatever you think is right) that way heat from theb initial 6mm will gradually spread.",

        "Water has an extremely high tolerance for heat. It takes a lot of energy to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree compared to ceramic, stone, steel, etc. It's also why it holds heat so long.

Again, I'm operating off these assumptions, so if I'm wrong on any of these, LMK. Now the *short* answers to your questions: I think you are on the right track by looking for an engineer to figure this out. It sounds like your product idea is going to rely on some mechanical parts and some textile parts, and getting them to work well together is going to be key to your success. (ETA: I'm an engineer, so I may have some bias here.) If I was in your place, I'd look for a mechanical engineer who also happened to be a seamstress/tailor, and if I couldn't find someone with both those skillsets, I'd get them in two people. You probably don't need a materials scientist unless you are planning to *design new materials*, which I'd recommend avoiding for your first new product. What you are looking for is frequently referred to as a consultant. Hiring consultants is easy, and there are various websites that will happily take some of your money to act as an intermediary. You can also poke around LinkedIn, your local technology council (my preferred method), nearby universities, ask your friends and acquaintances if they know anyone, or if you have any local manufacturers, walk in and ask. But first, let's talk about price: It varies widely, you might be able to pay a relatively new engineer who's needs a little extra cash for somewhere around $100 per hour (all prices assume you are in the USA). You might be able to pick up an established engineer with experience in your product field for \\~$200/hr. You might be able to hire an engineer who has significant experience in bra design for $300-500 per hour. You could also hire an industrial design firm, and they would likely tell you that it will cost somewhere between $10,000 and $50,000 to take a product from concept to workable design. (Rant: if this sounds like this is a stupid amount of money for a relatively simple product, I agree, but that's the nature of the business.) If I were in your shoes, I'd probably go cheap for starters, and only bring in the big guns when a really hard problem presents itself. When you are getting ready to hire someone, there are some important details you should plan for: You need to hire the RIGHT consultant; and you need to be very precise about what you want them to do for you. You should also get a rundown of the normal product development process, if you have not already. These things are part of the *LONG* answer, and I'm not going to type an even bigger wall of text unless a) I'm right about items 1 thru 4, and b) you want to hear it.",

Buy a bunch of adjustable products, go to the fabric store and grab materials that seem like they may work, pick up a cheap sewing machine and some fabric glue, and see if you can make something that kinda sorta works.

Nuclear power and propulsion is the next step in space exploration and will be necessary for long-term habitation and interplanetary travel between Earth, Mars, and the outer planets. We've used RadioIsotope Thermal electric  Generators (RTGs) on spacecraft since the 60s and have had actual nuclear reactors in space before. The Soviets launched many throughout the 60s - 90s and the US had launched one. We've also had Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NTR) engines since the 60s but have never flown a nuclear engine in space. Project DRACO, a project in conjunction with NASA and DARPA, is planning to test the first one in cislunar space around 2027. JETSON is another project in development with the United States Airforce Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the US Space Force to launch and test a Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) system sometime in the next few years. There's also a few commercial companies working on reactor and engine designs for future development.",

RTGs can provide a low amount of power for a very long time. Each of the Voyager probes has 3 RTGs that produced just shy of 160 watts of electric power each (470 watts total) on launch in 1977, a value which has dropped to about 220 watts total due to decay of the Pu-238 fuel. The Soviet Union launched a few dozen satellites with full blown compact nuclear reactors powering them. They were designed to propel the reactor into high orbit upon decommissioning rather than allowing the reactor to deorbit. However, several of these failed and one scattered radioactive debris all over Northern Canada.",

They have several disadvantages, namely cost and weight, that made them not *that* much better, at least not worth developing at the time, but DARPA is working on an NTR again right now as we speak.",

        "Free span resonances, contact pressure, tensioner stroke and system damping are the reasons guides are used rather than a single sprocket. Think of a timing chain as a banjo string and for every valve opening event or cylinder firing event you pluck it to some extent. For each free span of the chain (distance between two contact point) there is a natural frequency at which the chain vibrates. If that frequency is low enough, a resonance occurs within the engine operating range and very high loads are generated, either causing timing error, chain wear or failures. A guide contacts the chain over a long distance, damping and raising the natural frequency of the system. As there are only short distance of where the chain is not in contact. Which is why you\u2019ll see fixed guides placed elsewhere in the system and not just on the tensioned guide. The guides stay wear free due to the long contact area, the low contact pressure and the hydrodynamic oil film that\u2019s created between the sliding chain links and guide.",
        "Not familiar with those specific engines, but a sprocket requires the chain to wrap around it at a minimum angle, whereas a roller can contact as little or as much of the chain as it wants. As an extreme example, imagine a sprocket pressed up against a chain that is held taught in a straight, vertical line. It'd have a very odd contact angle. A roller also has less interference/contact with the chain overall. This in part is why you can get away with plastic, you're just gliding metal over the plastic in a large, flat area.",
        "Part of the chain sprockets noise and wear is caused by chain wondering and running against the side of the sprocket teeth. Sprocket idler doesn't help in that regard. Polymer tensioner/guide does, as it centers the chain on the chain line. Wear of the poly tensioner is solved by having long tensioner, and a lot of material to wear. Some designs have 15mm+ wear allowance, often enough for the life of the engine."

As an aside, the most efficient standalone freezer is are the chest style, as when they're opened the cold air tends to stay isolated where its at vs 'falling' out and getting displaced by warm air in vertical door models. Of course they suck to find things in the most too...",
        "some people who do van conversions or have RVs that want to maximize energy efficiency will buy chest freezers and adjust or replace the themostats on them to make them hit refrigerator temperatures because it is far more efficient than a normal refrigerator. Consider this. air is a fluid and cold air is more dense than warm air. So when you open a normal refrigerator door, what happens is essentially a slow motion version of if you had a swimming pool with a side opening door. You would open it and all the fluid inside would flow out into the ground. with air, all the cold air pours out and hot air flows in from the top. Now you have to use more energy to cool back down all that warm air that just filled in. If you use a chest freezer, you open the top, and some of the cold air due to boundary layer conditions and pressure changes from the moving door will get pulled out, but for the most part, all the cold air stays sitting in the freezer.  You close the lid and most of the cold air is still in there, so it takes very little energy to cool down the small amount of air that was replaced.",
        "If you live where there are occasional power outages, its very useful to get a chest-style freezer, with a lid on top. Heat rises and cold sinks. You can open the lid, take out a few things to cook, and the rest of the items will stay frozen for a very long time. If you get a generator, you can run it a couple times a week, and even just during the day which allows you to store it away from thieves at night.",
        "The most efficient technology for combined fridge/freezer is a dual evaporator design. The conventional designs do all of the heat pumping from a very cold freezer evaporator to a warm room, and then bleed some heat from the fridge compartment to the freezer to cool the fridge. That means every J of heat removed has to be \"lifted\" from the very cold freezer temp to the ambient. With a dual evaporator design, there's an evaporator in the refrigerator compartment that runs just cool enough to cool the fridge. Per unit energy removed, that requires less energy input. If you shop for fridges, it won't necessarily be those units that are the most efficient overall, because they are often on fancy units that have lots of energy-wasting features as well, and are also larger. A simple way to reduce energy use is to have thicker, better insulated walls. But for a given outside dimension, that reduces food storage capacity and people are too greedy for that to sell well."

At the most basic level you ask yourself two questions: (1) What's the minimum dimension of one part and maximum dimension of the other mating part in order for the assembly to work. Then similarly you ask: (2) what's the maximum dimension of the first part and minimum dimension of the second part in order for it to work. Then take those maximums and minimums for each part and find out the middle (nominal) dimension of each part and the +/- variance (tolerance). The nominal dimensions of each parts are typically the ones you draw in your CAD. You can then standardize it to ISO shaft/hole system but you don't need to. You can also chose to draw parts in an assembly at the minimum clearance that works, then indicate non-symmetrical variance from there.

For example on a crankshaft the bearing surfaces, and lengths of each journal, are important, and have a tight spec (and a well defined surface finish). The OD is also important but would have a looser tolerance. But the cheeks/webs of the counterweight can be left as cast."

That\u2019s pretty standard automotive-grade hardware that\u2019s thread into all sorts of aluminum alloys. Stainless isn\u2019t a bad choice either unless you are worried about the aluminum showing a bit of white corrosion (non-anodized). With anodizing, it\u2019s a great combo even in pretty harsh environments. Use some antiseize if you\u2019ll be torquing at the limit of the fastener.",

The young's modulus of all the steel bolts (grade 2, 5, 8) is going to be nearly identical. So the stretch of the bolts will be the same unless you reach the yield strength of the bolt. And, with grade 5 bolts having a yield strength around twice that of 6061 aluminum, I wouldn't expect significant yield from even the grade 5 threads before the aluminum yields.",
        "A quick summary of some of the commentary here and to add my own 2-cents: 1. Fastener material selection: \\- Grade 8 fastener going into 6061 is not a problem, provided care is taken when installing and torquing. Ensure both male and female threads are clean prior to install. I've seen my technicians both squirt a bit of isopropyl alcohol into a tapped hole and keep fasteners in a tin with alcohol while waiting to be installed. Alcohol also acts as a lubricant that doesn't get on other stuff like a petroleum-based lube. 2. Loads: Use washers under your SHCS to distribute your clamping force. (OH! re-read your post. You are using them! Great! Leaving this here anyway for other readers, just in case) 3. Alignment: Do not treat this like it's your car or a home repair project where you can use the bolts to align your mating parts. As you are already appropriately concerned about, over-torquing or cross-threading aluminum threads will destroy them. Ensure parts are properly aligned BEFORE installing fasteners. Consider a mechanical solution to aid in alignment such as: \\- small flanges on two orthogonal sides \\- dowel pins (with tolerances less than the loose-clearance of a 10-32) \\- some assembly fixture to align the parts 4. Torque: Consider installing all fasteners with a torque wrench to prevent over-torquing and stripping the threads 5. Why not use a treaded insert? If you're afraid of tapped holes in aluminum (and you rightly should, as I am), consider investing in threaded inserts. Much more robust and you can replace them if they strip-out."

Electrical engineers are far more active in programming than mechanical engineers are (based on my school requirements), but if you want to dive deeper into computers you can always shoot for something like computer engineering. Nower days, it seems inevitable that you will learn some programming for your engineering degree but you\u2019ll do a lot more in electrical than mechanical. Mechanical engineers (my degree) do things like stress testing, heat transfer, and design of physically parts. HVAC is one of the biggest industries for mechanical engineers. When you think about \u201cmechanical\u201d in the title, don\u2019t think of a mechanic who would work on cars and stuff, but think of mechanics, as in physics. I can\u2019t honestly tell you much about what electrical engineers are expected to do as I am not studying that! It seems like they spend a lot of the time producing circuits and other electrical components. Either way, electrical and mechanical engineers are required for basically any project so there is a lot of flexibility in what you want to do with your degree. Ultimately, the things you work in in engineering are determined by your specific discipline within your field, rather than what your bachelor degree happened to be. For example, I\u2019m in a mechanical engineering program right now, which would normally direct me toward something like HVAC, but I want to work on robotics so I\u2019m grabbing as many programming and robotics courses as I can. Once I\u2019m applying for jobs, my robotics experience should help Direct me toward my field. Take this with a grain of salt since I AM still a student. If you aren\u2019t too picky about the work you end up doing then the word is having an engineering degree at all will get you a bunch of different jobs. Seems like a lot of employers value that \u201cengineering mindset\u201d and the fact that you are able to complete a difficult degree at all. I hear that a decent chunk of engineering graduates end up working in finance, taking advantage of their higher math skills. Anyway I hope all that helps. Know that, whatever you choose to do, you will spend a lot of your time ON the computer in engineering. If it\u2019s between electrical and mechanical then choose electrical to get closer to computer programming, but consider computer engineering as well. It\u2019s less about data science than a computer science degree would be and you get to learn more about how a computer physically works. P.S. Don\u2019t worry so much about the creativity stuff. First: don\u2019t put yourself down so much, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re just as creative as the next person. Second: engineers are not exactly renowned for being creative types. Most engineering will not be isaac newton-style inventing of new disciplines and approaches, but will be making minor modifications to existing parts. Part of the reason I\u2019m going for robotics is that I believe it will open the door to more creative work than engineering usually does. In school, you will be rewarded much more for your ability to retain and regurgitate the subject matter than coming up with creative approaches."

        "I want to try to offer an answer that is not over-complicated, but I am frankly not seeing a way. Some of the other comments may be useful, but it's worth being extremely thorough where your health and safety is concerned. The question you're asking, which boils down to \"do I know if my part will break under load before I test it?\", is something mechanical engineers can make entire careers out of. There are countless things that are going to factor into the answer to the question... not the least of which is your specific design geometry. There is no real way to \"eyeball\" the stress. It depends way too much on the specific geometry and features of your design. The bottom line to answer this question is you have to be able to determine the maximal stress in your part. Generally speaking, and particularly with well-studied metals like steel, if your actual stress is below the yield strength of the material, then the material will neither deform nor break. If your safety bar is a cantilever then you *might* be able to perform an analytical assessment of the stress. If it's fixed on both ends then you have an indeterminate beam, which is more challenging to solve analytically. The impact scenario muddies the water even further in that you can no longer just use statics. If you want to model this scenario, you will probably need software and FEM analysis. Even then you need to be pretty skilled with FEM to get effective and sensible results that you can trust. You're really better off just testing. A test is absolute, at least in a single instance. However, a single test cannot account for fatigue over time, which causes your material strength to decreases as it is cycled over many cycles. As a rule of thumb, items can be considered \"non-fracture-critical\" if you design the part to be stressed under 30% of the materials tensile/ultimate strength. This makes fracture as a result of fatigue extremely unlikely. Obviously stress analysis is needed for this. If this were my project and it concerned my health and safety, I would do the following: * Try to design the geometry to be such that I could perform an analytical stress assessment. * Choose a strong, ductile, well-studied steel. Something with very high toughness that is extremely unlikely to catastrophically fracture, and would more likely dent or deform before outright breaking. * When choosing where to get the steel bar, you probably should stick to cold-rolled. Hot rolling introduces some weakness to the material. * Do the analytical stress assessment and compare to the chosen materials yield and ultimate strength. * Make the full model of the entire frame in CAD and do an FEM stress analysis. * Compare the results of the two analyses to see if we're in the same ballpark for verification. * Ensure stress is below 30% of the ultimate strength of the steel to preclude fatigue. * Ensure yield FOS is 1.5 or above and ultimate FOS is 2.0 and above. This is standard in my industry. * Build it and drop your maximum load on it from the maximum height several times and see if it survives.",

If these heavy impact loads start cracking the lumber then it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess when structural failure could occur. (I\u2019ll also mention fastening as critical here as nobody has mentioned it, but fasteners can crack the wood as they are installed, and you should be careful to ensure that your wood is in compression and that you aren\u2019t putting fasteners into shear unless they are intended for that purpose.)

Large databases require lots of tuning to ensure this is the case. Very large databases (Google, Amazon, etc) are broken up across **many** servers to ensure that they never pull data from a disk or SSD. Even reading from very fast disks is much, much slower than RAM. As for component wear, RAM can basically be written/read an unlimited number of times without issue. SSDs can be read an almost unlimited number of times and an individual data cell can be written ~100k times. The disk firmware tracks the writes and spreads them across cells to minimize early burnout and SSDs have a certain amount of extra space that they will use to replace any cells that are wearing out early. Actual disks have a limited number of write cycles, but even heavily used disks are more likely to die from physically wearing out from spinning than from write cycles. TLDR: unless you are seriously punishing the disks, you don't need to personally worry about it",

You would use a RAID array or something like that so that any one SSD failure would not be fatal. I know there is also technology to accelerate common database queries by updating the query result simultaneously with database transactions, rather than recomputing the query itself. But this is outside my real area of knowledge. And could be obsolete also. But I am sure that a lot of specialized engineering knowledge is applied to these issues.

The specific failure mode is if the mains neutral gets disconnected at the source, but the safety gnd remains. Your little uP will suddenly find itself at mains \"hot\" potential due to the circuit through the load. The next (and more obvious) concern is that, if a 2-conductor plug is used like in the U.S., then that plug could be installed backwards and again your uP ends up on the mains hot voltage. The typical solution is to get a current transformer. A more modern solution is to get a current-sensing IC that uses the Hall effect [like this one]. Either can be quite accurate.

The buildings are brutalist concrete structures, so most of them are still standing, but 40 years later they are already coming apart, and already more visible from the air than the ground because with no-one holding back trees and plants, nature is reclaiming them and trees have surrounded them, hiding them. (It is surprising how close you can be to a building and not notice anything but nature until just a few yards away. Plants take root in cracks and the roots grow over time and widen cracks and slowly break up structures. Similarly freeze/thaw cycles, etc. Even large solid concrete platforms have their hard edges broken off, the fragments pile around the base softening the shape further, and it starts looking more and more like shale outcroppings, less like artificial structure. Wind-blown dirt collects in corners and gaps and also smooths things out. Most of these processes involve water. Buildings where the roofs are still keeping out water (and there are still many), everything is still in great condition. Once the roof starts leaking the rest of the structure starts deteriorating. I would think there will still be large dirt / rubble mounds there for hundreds of years, presumably thousands, but someone might have to examine the structures with a geological mindset to notice its origins are artificial. In a few hundred years I think clear evidence would remain that the rubble hills were artificial *if someone was looking for evidence*, but I think it would look like a fairly natural area to a casual eye otherwise To safely live in a building hundreds of years later, a dry area (infrequent rain) would help.

I would say the walls are pretty much ok, but a different building had a tree growing out of a crack in the wall and it reached a decent size in a few short years before it was removed and has probably weakened the structure considerably.

Sound is slow\u2026light is very, very fast.",
        "So one big reason it\u2019s fast is because probably like 99% of the path it takes is on a wired network. It\u2019s only wireless from your phone to the tower, then it travels over a wired network to a different tower, where it is wirelessly transmitted to the receiver. So that helps a lot because the data can move quickly once it gets to the tower and into the carriers network. This whole network was designed specifically for transmitting voice data. So unlike the internet which has to support all kinds of data and generally tries to find the cheapest path, on a phone network you can have guarantees that your data packet is going to take the shortest path, and it will not be blocked by other higher priority packets. Even when they added data plans on cell phones, they made sure it wouldn\u2019t interfere with the voice data going through the networks. So even though it\u2019s not like the old days where you had a physical wire connected from your phone to the other phone, in some ways it is theoretically like that, in that there is a network path that gets opened up for your call data once the call is connected, and the carrier will do their best to make sure your call data gets through. Regarding encoding the voice data into bits, that isn\u2019t lossless at all. It uses very lossy algorithms that are designed to be able to encode things very fast and use a small amount of data. Voice data generally has a small band of frequency content, so it\u2019s relatively easy to encode compared to something like music (this is why hold music quality sucks, they are transmitting music using the voice encoding methods). Finally to answer your question about satellites, there is usually a pretty noticeable delay on satellite phone calls.",
        "Compression and digitization of voice may not work exactly how you'd think it might. The audio signal of your voice doesn't get recorded and compressed in the same way as recording yourself with a microphone and making an mp3 of that recording. One of the ways it's done is by using what's called linear predictive coding for voice communications. LPC basically starts with the assumption that there's only so many sounds a human can make; basically all the characteristics of human vocal cords, throat, lips, ect., everything that goes into making speech, was used to come up with a model that could represent all the sounds we could make. It sounds really complex (and it is), but using that information we can digitally represent speech with significantly fewer bits than actually recording and digitizing the sound. When you talk into the phone it more or less determines what sounds you've made most closely matches the model of what sounds a human can make and instead of actually sending the audio of your voice, it sends the information about the sound that most closely represents the sounds you've made. It does this about 30-50 times a second. That's also why anything that's not human voice sounds terrible over the phone. This isn't the only way it's done, and there's probably more knowledgeable people than me who could explain it more accurately, but I hadn't seen anyone else mention it and I think it's important to include information about techniques like this when discussing latency in the phone system.",
        "What's gonna bake your noodle is, there are many calls going on at the same time over the same fiber/frequency. How do they not get scrambled? Only one call \"talks\" at once. People can probably explain it better than me but basically the system takes what you've said over the last few milliseconds and compresses it into a much shorter amount of time.",

        "To add to the mind fuck. Not only do we have good phone calls. We could have even better ones if we felt like it. We fully have the capability to have theater quality audio on calls. Instead the nerds at the phone company realized we could delete half of the sound data and humans wouldn\u2019t notice. With the 1/2 of the now open data we\u2019re able to splice in another caller. Without either conversation knowing, you\u2019re actually using the same lines together. ((We can splice in more than 1 but for example let\u2019s assume we only split in one more)) Now AGAIN the cell nerds found out you can split the data by signal phase. As an analogy, if I\u2019m speaking in super high pitch tone and the other people are speaking with super low tones. Both of our conversations can happen simultaneously and neither of us would notice/hear the other. That\u2019s a very poor analogy to how phased signal works. So now we have 1x2x2 conversations. And AGAIN the nerds found a way to splice EVEN more data into the same cells lines. We can compress the data with an algorithm.

        "Kayaks Are all about core strength. You cannot do Eskimo rolls without the core strength and coordination that is needed by having four working limbs. the same with canoes. Power when paddling is generated from leaning into the stroke and using your back and hips to generate power when paddling. Paddling in canoeing is not in the arms, it is in the back. both of these boats are inherently unstable and require active management by the people in the boat.",
        "I've done a few design projects to adapt equipment to para-athletes. These ideas exist, I would suggest you contact different athletic organizations in your country, they can often help you get equipment or point you in the right direction. You don't necessarily need to design/build from scratch. Look at sculling boats used by paralympic athletes: Doing something similar with double outriggers may work for you, though launching a boat with double outriggers might be challenging. Seems like a similar idea (single outrigger) might be employed for para-canoe/kayak: It seems only a few boats in that video have an outrigger, probably depends on the persons capabilities. They also appear to have something supporting the core of a few athletes.",
        "Metacenter height is a critical parameter in vessel design. I'm rather tall, and I had to make my own kayak in order to enjoy positive stability at all in any production whitewater kayak. If you are looking to invest time for this project (it sounds really rewarding, and I found it rewarding looking back at the decades I've enjoyed my kayak), you might research the availability for fiberglass kayak molds. You could modify the plug to accommodate the additional needs. I built mine off of an Old Town mold set some decades ago. They were floating around at colleges for at least a few decades after that. Barring that, then the choice is a bit more dramatic. To get your husband's CG below the metacenter height of the vessel, you will need to modify the width, displacement profile, or add ballast to an existing kayak. It is a neat problem. Widening certainly reduces maneuverability. Ballast is cumbersome. The profile cam be modified such that maneuverability is less affected. A kayak is nicest when it has a smooth stability transition from rocking, rather than reaching neutral stability quickly before going negative. So increasing the profile section throughout the roll is the most straightforward way to do that. That means gluing foam boards to the bottom/side of the kayak and sculpting it to reduce drag. Then the restorative rolling moment will push the metacentric height up, perhaps by the several inched you will need to assist your husband. One good measure of stability as a target is to sit in the kayak yourself and rock it and determine the frequency of the oscillations back and forth. The higher the frequency, the better the stability. Slow restoration means you are approaching neutral to negative stability territory. When I built mine, I had a normal height person sit in it, rocked it, then I sat in it, and added barbell weights to the bottom until I got to the same frequency while rocking. It was a lot of weight, but the stability was negative without the weight at all. But I could use that to calculate the metacentric height of the boat with me or the other person, and used that to calculate how much deeper the profile had to be for the boat, and added that to the mold plug with foam sheets that I cut with an electric turkey knife and a belt sander before applying wax and laying up the lower part of the boat. The width did not change- the boat became less rounded and more flat with the additional material at the sides. It worked well, and I have enjoyed it on class IV in most years over the decades since. It took about 1.5-2\" of additional foam board in areas. It is very uncomfortable for whitewater for anyone else of average height (too stable for them), but very spicy with my higher CG. As for the seat back, nice idea. I would definitely plan for a spring loaded setup to make roll recovery possible in a whitewater situation if that is the case, or for maneuvering in big waves (leaning back). And make it narrow to allow rotation of the torso when needed during rolls and paddling. I would think that using large rivets to attach the seat back would be perfectly ok on a plastic boat. For fiberglass, yo have the option to bond and rivet. And I'm always hoping for advances in myasthenia gravis...who knows what the monocolonals will be able to do in time. Best wishes."

        "EV owner here that works in the medium heavy duty EV space- it depends a lot on the EV you're looking at, just like any other vehicle! I was under the hood of my eGolf last night chasing an issue with the heater. All high voltage wires will have florescent orange looms- those are the ones you want to be careful not to touch. On the eGolf there is a connection from the charge port (back of the car, where the fuel door is) to the charger (under the hood, rectifies the AC, negotiates DC charging, etc); one from the charger to the battery, one from the battery to the motor inverter, one from the motor inverter to the motor, from the battery to the high voltage coolant heater, from the battery to the DC-DC converter (like an alternator, turns the 600V link into 12V for accessories), and one from the battery to the refrigerant compressor for the A/C. There are two wires in every case (they don't ground to the chassis like a low voltage system)- except there are more from the inverter to the motor (one for each phase). You can pretty quickly visually determine which box does what under the hood. For more traditional \"lines\" - The eGolf doesn't have an active battery thermal management system (BTMS), but there is a coolant loop that includes the motor, inverter, charger (the actual active rectifier part, not the port), heater core, a high voltage resistance heater, and a small radiator. The lines are significantly smaller in diameter and the coolant actually doesn't get warm enough to throw off heat since there isn't a large amount of waste heat from these systems- thus the resistance heater (which on my car is not coming on for a yet undetermined reason). The eGolf has electric power steering, so no hydraulic lines or power steering fluid. The eGolf has traditional hydraulic brakes, the same as on its sister models, so there is a brake fluid reservoir and steel lines from the master cylinder to each caliper. There is an electronic vacuum pump that supports the hydraulic advantage typically supplied by the intake manifold. There is a traditional r134a refrigerant loop for the A/C system, complete with an electric compressor and an evaporator. It's tucked out of the way though, and much smaller since it does not need a clutch or to be inline with the accessory belt. All of the 12V wiring is identical to any other sister car, a lead acid battery with fuse boxes, etc. The 12V system is also required to close the contactors (basically a fancy relay that connects the high voltage batteries to everything) so without it the car won't start and will require a \"jump\" like any other car. In place of the alternator there is a DC-DC converter which runs to power the accessories and maintain the low voltage battery when the contractor is shut/car is on. That's the high level- there is lots of space \"under the hood\" since a significant number of the components are smaller and there isn't a requirement to be in line with the accessory belt. Now with more vehicle comes more complexity! I also happen to work with electric buses (mostly transit, some school) and I've seen some hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles as well. Buses and most modern vehicles often have active BTMS- so there are extra coolant lines through the battery packs, and most have a pneumatic system for the suspension and doors. Hydrogen fuel cell EVs also have high-pressure fuel lines, tanks, etc. One thing you'll hopefully take away from all of this- EVs are *an order of magnitude* simpler than their internal combustion counterparts. This makes them significantly more reliable, and the ongoing/preventative maintenance requirements are low cost and infrequent. Hope this is helpful!",
        "It depends on the vehicle. I have a 2023 Chevy Bolt. It has three coolant loops. All three have a coolant reservoir and a variable speed electric pump. The first has a resistive heater and runs into the cabin to a heater core to heat the cabin. The second is the electronics cooling. It runs through the DC-DC converter (which steps down the HV battery to power the 12 volt electronics), the battery charger, and the inverter. On some models/years of the Bolt it also runs through a heat exchanger on the motor/gearbox assembly. The loop also runs through a radiator on the front of the car, which is how it\u2019s cooled. The third loop runs through the battery to heat or cool the battery. It runs through a resistive heater for heat and also through a water-cooled evaporator connected to the AC compressor for cooling. This loop does NOT connect to a radiator directly, it either heats, does nothing, or cools using the AC compressor. The AC compressor has the aforementioned evaporator in the battery cooling loop, plus runs to en evaporator inside the cabin for cooling. There must be valves so it can select battery or cabin cooling without cooling the other system, but I haven\u2019t dug into it that much. The AC then runs into a condenser radiator that\u2019s mounted next to the main radiator in the front of the car. There\u2019s a fan to draw air through both radiators if needed, just like a ICE car. Then there\u2019s brake fluid, which is used for hydraulic disk brakes, like a normal car. I\u2019m unsure if they use a vacuum pump or directly pump brake fluid for power brake assist. Finally there\u2019s the motor, which is inside the gearbox case. Also inside the case is a 7.5(?)-1 fixed ratio gear assembly and a differential. To lubricate the bearings, gears, and differential the case is filled with normal transmission fluid. And to cool the motor there\u2019s a small electric pump that pumps transmission fluid from the bottom of the case and sprays it over the motor stator coil. The transmission fluid is cooled by the case, which has molded air fins. Also in some models/years the case also has a bolted on water heat exchanger, that is cooled via the electronic cooling loop described previously. On the other models/years, it\u2019s cooled only by air. I think that\u2019s pretty much it. Lots of electric wiring everywhere too. Weber Auto on YouTube has a bunch of detailed videos on the Bolt. Since you asked about fluid lines, here\u2019s a direct link to the coolant system I just described:",
        "EV owner and firefighter here: Similar to ICE cars, EVs have all lines concerning A/C, Brakes, wiper fluid, low voltage power (lights and stuff). Mine has coolant lines for the engine and battery. No heater core, heating is done both by the A/C circuit and an electric heater. Obviously no oil, fuel or air lines exvept for the A/C intake. They do have high voltage lines (mandated to be orange where I live)."

The neck area has a lot of blood vessels going to the brain, and cooling that will be very effective for increased comfort and reduced risk of heat stroke. If you want the extreme case of overalls with AC, look at a space suit. They are just that. If you want to create something a little bit less complicated, but more advanced than a cooling towel, I would start with a cooling vest or something, possibly including a hoodie to cool the head and neck area. The innermost layer should be dry, or at least have air channels open to your skin so moisture evaporating off your body can be blown away. you want to feel dry. The next layer should be waterproof, then a wet layer and then finally more air channels. The air channels blow air on the wet layer, make the water evaporate, cooling it in the process, and blow away the moist air. Battery powered fan to move the air, a controller to adjust the air flow and temperature, and a way to refill the wet layer as needed.

At the old density, brass was common. You want a material of a known and consistent density. A density close to the international prototype standard would be ideal, but platinum iridium is really expensive and difficult to work with. Stainless steel is a great compromise. Stainless is better than brass as there is less concern with oxidation, it is harder and easy enough to work with. This is generally true for standards up to about 20 kg depending upon classification. After that, cast iron, or even fabricated steel becomes the materials of choice. These are almost certainly a lower class weight. See oiml R111 to learn all you ever wanted to know about mass standards.",
        "Depends on the scale, and how reliable you need it to be. Very precise 1kg standards sometimes use a Platinum\u2013iridium alloy. Cheaper ones use stainless steel or other alloys. If you want mass standards in the 100+ kg range it\u2019s typically stainless or machined cast iron. Sometimes cast iron is plated. Mass standards have to be both hard and chemically resistant. You want hardness as it\u2019s less likely to be scratched and worn down. You want chemical resistance because if it reacts with the air through oxidation it gains mass.

        "Hi, physics guy here, I think OP's question is a good one and deserves a little more thought. /u/Greg_Esres and /u/Johnny_Lang_1962 make the great point that OP is talking about a ducted fan, and that these are used in the turbofan engines that power most modern jetliners. But why aren't they *ever* used in smaller aircraft? My understanding is that ducted fans give really big efficiency gains in almost all cases, from cooling fans to ship's propellers to turbofan engines, they're everywhere *except* on small aircraft. Makes me wonder if there's a fundamental flaw here rather than little incremental tradeoffs. And you *do* see some historical ducted fan test aircraft, like the [Bell X-22] and the [XV-11 Marvel] and [whatever this thing is]. But almost never. My best guess, and it's only a guess, is that it's a combination of propeller size and speed limits. An open-air propeller has to move at less than the speed of sound, or things get horrifyingly loud and violent. Since speed is limited, the only way to increase thrust is to vary the propeller's pitch (which turboprops already do) or increase the area of the propeller. But you can't make the propeller so big that it might hit the ground or (for twin-props) the side of the aircraft. In just about every propeller plane I've looked at, the prop is as big as possible without being so big as to hit something. If you enclose the propeller in a duct, *it* can't hit the ground either, so you have to reduce the propeller's size to make it fit. I speculate that the extra gain in efficiency is outweighed by the loss of propeller swept area. Turbofan and turbojet engines, on the other hand, are designed with supersonic blades from start to finish so the blade speed limit doesn't apply. Low Mach number props like ships' propellers and cooling fans also don't have to worry about this. There may be other factors too -- [Wikipedia] mentions extra drag, and the fact that the duct counts as a wing, so you have to worry about it stalling at high angles of attack. And of course there isn't necessarily a fundamental flaw here, it could just be a marginal decision that always goes against ducted fans for small aircraft. But still I can't help wondering if we're missing something.",
        "If you are thinking that for the reason of protecting the prop, it would have the opposite effect if something of mass actually hit the guard. Deflecting it back into the prop, as well as blocking air passage like a plugged strainer.. A goose / bird has a chance of hitting the prop and possibly damaging it...if it hits a grill, operation issues are a guarantee.",
        "Here's something no one is talking about. In all but the lightest propellor driven airplanes, the props are constant speed, variable pitch. What this allows you to do is run the motor at a fixed speed but vary the pitch to change the aircraft speed. This allows for engine optimization and maximum performance, and improved reliability. It was tried in the 30's by an Italian Engineer, and it was called the [Stipa Caproni]. It did not offer any major benefit, and in fact the \"shrouding\" caused enough drag to eliminate any benefit. Variable pitch propellors are a far better solution to optimize the propellor."

        "The airforce tried an indirectly heated nuclear jet engine, but while they managed to fly the reactor, could never make the thermodynamics work to get sufficient thrust from the thing, it used a very partial shield only protecting the crew, which must have been unpopular with the ground staff. There was an air breathing Nuclear Ramjet, and they actually fired the thing up on a test stand (Project Pluto. and yes, it was as nuts as it sounds). The intent was an unmaned nuclear drone bomber, in the 1960s. The US army, in a fit of nuke envy built a truck mounted gas cooled power generating reactor, the economics did NOT stack up, but that may have been due to the zen nature of military research projects. They avoided the need for shielding by simply requiring a rather large exclusion zone around the thing when it was in operation! The elephant in the room is that shielding tends to be sort of important and that does not scale down well as cores become smaller and more power dense, a 100MW core needs much the same thickness of concrete and steel as a 1GW one does, granted the 1GW unit has a larger core diameter. Small highly enriched reactors are also tricky, tricky things, nearly nothing about a fission plant gets better as they get smaller.",

However if you want to heat a building or something like that it's a much better option. However to answer your question Research projects have kinda started into molten salt storage. Might be more, but I haven't seen much beyond theoretical stage and it's usually a day to night thing. Not a season to season thing.",
        "It's a great solution but the economics are yet to be proven at scale. Thermal storage systems have much lower capital costs than lithium batteries, especially for longer duration storage. They also have lower round-trip efficiencies because they use the steam cycle - about 40% energy return instead of 85%. That means lower operating profits than batteries coz much of the electricity they take in is wasted and not sold on. (Still way better efficiency than hydrogen.) So it's a classic capex/opex trade-off. For long storage, the higher capex on batteries makes thermal storage cheaper. For short storage, the better opex on batteries means thermal can't compete. What's long and short here? Batteries are dominating for less than two hours, maybe less than four. Thermal will work for multi-day storage. What happens in the middle? Too early to say. As well as storing heat in rocks or sand, you can store heat as molten metal or silicon. Most of the energy is stored as the latent heat of melting/solidification, meaning that the heat is released at the melting point of the material, making is easy to generate steam at a constant temperature. Steam turbines like steam at a constant 550C or so, making aluminium the perfect material for this. That makes connecting to existing steam turbines pretty trivial. [MGA Thermal] in Australia are working on this technology (and I'm an investor in MGA, because I think it's a great technology)."

But if you're making food for sale? Those are expensive because they need testing, rating, documentation and tons of administrative overhead. You're not really paying for the ball mill, you're paying for that chain of testing and accountability.",
        "Like someone else said, people don't understand all the levels of manufacturing and all the levels of certifications involved. Especially when it comes to critical safety items like food related products. The company digging up the metal ore might not be the one smelting it. The company smelting it might not be the one making components from it. The company making the components may not be the one making assembled parts from it. The company making the assembled parts might not be the one making the completed product. And the company making the final product might not even be the one selling it. In between each of these steps, whether it's within the same company or not, there will be various inspections, tests, certifications, etc that need to be passed. Those checks are done by paying other companies to do them or the company has to pay for people and equipment to do it internally. All this adds to the cost on top of already paying for the design and specific materials for being food safe. I work in aerospace so i see the same thing in even stuff as simple as bolts. If I just need a bolt to decorative knob for a piece of furniture, then hell I could probably just melt down some aluminum cans, pour the molten metal into a homemade bolt mold, clean it up and be good to go. Or of course just grab one for a dollar from a home improvement store. But if I need a bolt that's going into an aircraft that could kill people if it fails and needs to hold loads, vibrations, be in a corrosive environment, etc etc then I'm going to have to be more picky. A bolt supplier might come to me selling a bolt of a spec I need. But I need to review all the documentation of who made that bolt. Then, I need the documentation of test methods and results of how that manufacturer tests batches of bolts they make. And the documentation of where the stock material for the bolts and the testing it's undergone. And the documentation of where the stock material came from. Like I said before, each of those steps might have documentation from internal to each company or could be from outside sources. For example, the company making stock of xyz metal might pay an unaffiliated materials lab to test each batch of their product before it goes to get turned into a bolt. But also, I'll look at the reliability of each company in this process. Perhaps one of the companies has a history of quality escapes or a lab has been caught having inaccurate tests that might pass faulty products. That's more documentation and time spent. Or if it's companies we don't have a history with, then I have to have my companies materials lab test the products, create documentation, and then review said documentation. Each step and inspection/test/etc costs money and takes time (which also costs money). Similar to food safe stuff, this is on top of any specific costly requirements such as material choice. Maybe I don't need a food safe material, but I need an expensive \"aerospace grade\" alloy that's better but more expensive than melted aluminum cans."

        "There's probably a couple decades of runway just off the mechanicals, pin count, and capabilities so far. USB-A's mechanical problems (takes three tries to align it right, bigger than Jony Ive wanted to deal with) feel like the biggest issues, and part of the move to C was putting in even more pins for more modes to confuse people trying to buy wires and support more use cases. So what are the complaints with USB-C? Does it get gunked up? Are either side of the connector particularly fragile? Would different mechanicals or more pins solve a problem? Can the USB Implementors Forum figure out a new naming scheme that nobody will understand? A replacement will take these into consideration.",
        "Basically USB-C, but with fiber. The electrical part is fine forever, 240W is more than plenty for anything you want to carry around. If you need more power in portable electronics it's either going to become stupidly heavy, stupidly hot, or both. The USB 2.0 part will also stick around for a *really* long time. It's trivial to implement, and more than enough for something like a mouse, keyboard, sound card, or printer. What's left is high-speed data, which means monitors or SSDs. USB4 already limited passive cable length to 80cm, which is awkwardly short. There is a little bit of room for growth left in copper, but not a lot. On the other hand, fiber can already carry many orders of magnitude more with current-day technology. Longer USB-C cables already use fiber but the copper-to-fiber part is in the cable itself, which makes the cable *really* expensive. We're not too far off speed-wise from fiber basically being mandatory, at which point it makes a lot more sense to just do the copper-to-fiber part in the devices instead of the cable. If we're *very* lucky, it'll happen in a way which is backwards compatible with USB-C - a bit like those hybrid 3.5mm-and-Toslink jacks from a decade ago. On the other hand, I don't expect this to be needed very soon. The main driver for higher data rates right now is monitors, and we're already approaching a point where a higher resolution doesn't really make sense because you're already at the limits of human vision. Feeding uncompressed video to three 8K 240Hz monitors takes something like 600Gbps - and USB-C can currently already do 120Gbps. If they can manage a 4x increase, they're basically good until something completely new gets invented which needs like 1Tbps.",
        "To the USB-C connector itself, only minor changes to support additional bandwidth. The USB-C connector is extremely well thought out. It's small, bidirectional, rugged, supports as much power transport as can be had while still remaining safe for humans to touch (you can't go above 48v and pushing the amperage any higher on a single conductor would be crazy). It's really hard to think of what more you could ask of a single connector. I do think we may someday see sister connectors that are nothing more than a doubled-up, trebled-up, etc., versions of USB-C to support additional power and communications lines in order to facilitate single-wire connections between higher power/bandwidth desktop components: a \"USB-Cx2\", x4, x8, x16 exactly like we have PCIx1/x2/x4/x8/x16. These connectors would support 480W/960W/1920W/4KW and 80Gbps/160Gbps/320Gbps/640Gbps. Such a connector would simply be 2/4/8/16 USB-C connectors side-by-side at a specific spacing with cables produced to match. It would be backward compatible in two senses: you could use any combination of USB C x1/x2/x4/x8/x16 cables to attach the two devices, and you can also connect two devices using fewer than the maximal number of cables supported on the connector, but at a reduced maximal bandwidth and power. You could also connect multiple devices to a \"single\" x16 connector simply by using multiple smaller connectors going to different devices. Basically, any two devices with any number of USB-C cables between them, with cables made that have multiple contacts purely for convenience sake. This would facilitate things like external RTX 4090s to be powered and run externally at a bandwidth equivalent to PCIe 5.0/16. (Presumably the bitrate would rise pretty much in sync with PCIe 6.0/7.0....)",
        "That depends on whatever the USB Implementers Forum and its members decides is the next standard. If the Tech Industry finds USB-C insufficient in 10-20 Years and needs a new port, a new standard will be proposed, implemented, and then every 5 years the EU will give them a chance to force the standard on device manufacturers.",

The connector itself doesn't seem to have any particularly significant issues right now. We'll likely see improved data rates or higher wattages introduced over time but that'll be backwards compatible. It'll be similar to how we still use USB-A for plenty of things. Sure Apple could introduce another connector, adapter sales has been their primary business model. But at this stage it doesn't look like USB-C will become obsolete anytime soon.",

        "Given that some of the newer iterations of Type C are capable of ridicules; -up and down load speeds -power transmission (wattage at different voltages) -rather easy and reliable in terms of connection -also the able to pass through video signals I can\u2019t see there being much of a move on from it atleast not for a significant time. The only issue at the moment is if the owner of the standard like HDMI decide to refuse its usage to certain parties",
        "Nothing. The EU made it law that all phones have to have USB-C so if manufacturers want to change to a new connector then they will have to make two SKUs, one for Europe and one for everywhere else. That will be expensive so it won't happen. We are stuck with it for eternity.",
        "People will gradually forget how amazing standardization is and the system will collapse leaving us with an assorted bunch of garbage again. Apple tries every year, they'll likely be the first to succeed. And then Samsung will get jealous of how badly Apple is able to abuse its customers and follow suit.",

As for the power part, probably wireless power supply would be developed as the replacement. But considering the energy loss by current stage, power plant would be a giant issue, haha.

The groove intersects this spill port at different heights depending on how the plunger is positioned. The plunger always makes a full stroke, it's just riding on a cam lobe. The start of injection always begins at the same crankshaft position, but ends when the helix meets the spill port. Rack at idle, the spill happens very early. Rack at full power, the port opens much later. The rack is controlled by the governor, and sometimes had other linkages to allow more fuel with turbo boost, for cold startup, and maybe others. The standard pumps used for decades did not sense anything but throttle position (and rpm / crank position since they're geared to the motor).",

Some other bits adjust fuel pressure to tune for engine temperature etc. Used by Volvo and Volkswagen in the 70s and 80s it's pretty good and easy to adjust if you have a manual and a pressure gauge."

Liability studies, all the good stuff that is part of being a pioneer. Consider the Ford and their considerable resources will take at least three years to build the blue oval city facility. Without doubt, they would have done so faster if it was possible. They have no reason to delay their return on investment, certainly no desire delaying capturing the market share. Also, it will take a similar amount of time to ramp up speed and capacity, hiring and training, fixing the initial plan as they go. Likewise, they had even more time creating the plan, the contracts, legal permissions, etc. I use automotive because everyone has exposure to the product. It is also largely physical and easy for people to relate to. While certainly a subset of automotive, chemical and electrical also carries similar challenges, but harder to see and troubleshoot in many cases.

        "Often processes that work in a lab have additional problems when you move to prototype size, more trouble when you build industrial size plant with customer expectations I once worked on a plant that arose from a lab size experimental rolling mill about10 centimetres wide. The process used sprayed solidification stainless steel powder particles which had a rough surface. These were crushed in a rolling mill with very hard rolls and it would form a delicate but handleably sheet that could be passed through a reducing atmosphere furnace designed to support the material on a flame cushion, the shape of the bed being the natural catenary o the strip of that weight. All very clever. The resulting sintered strip that would tolerate being cold-rolled reducing it by 80% and crushing the particles tightly together. A further sintering pass created usable stainless steel strip. Moving up to a prototype plant rolls of about 1 meter wide the scaling suggested pressures of about 1000 tonnes; big leap. The real economic breakthrough would be to produce 1.5 meter wide strip or greater. The prototype mill and the reducing furnace were already sized to 1.5 meters I think. I designed and commissioned the control system and early experiments proved to need 1400 tonnes, all that the cylinders or mill cold stand. Now the projection for a 1.5 or 2 metre mill became a very impressive load indeed. We would have to start again, the rolls also already distorted at the loads we were using and spawling was seen (dangerous, the metal stores energy and the surface can spontaneously eject bits of metal at high speed, lethal) In the end the plant was mothballed and, as far as I know never did become viable for production. During initial trials of the mill; big demo day the first usable steel expected; but the control system  showed signs of instability, throwing hundreds of tonnes from one side to the other. I tried to tell the ego who was in charge that the mill was running to destruction. I was waved away with distain; he was not having any of it, raining on his parade. I tried to talk to his second in command; but he wanted to stand next to the chief to get maximum reflected glory. So I approached the guy operating the mill and told him. He was no engineer and did not understand. I took one look at the load instruments and pressed the red button closing the whole plant. What bloody fool argues with the systems designer when they tell you that an experimental plant that they designed, built and commissioned, is about to kill somebody, even him. I received a letter some time later banning me from the plant. A letter I stored carefully; it was a get out of jail card. Steel mills are dangerous enough places without a fool in charge.",
        "When you have 1 prototype, you\u2019re able to see failure modes that affect approximately 100% of all working models. When you have 10, then you can see failure modes that affect 1 in 10. When you have 100, then you can see failure modes that affect 1 in 100. All the way up to however many copies you need to make. Each rarer failure mode is harder to reproduce, harder to root cause. They have increasingly weird and esoteric ways of failing. But you have to solve them. If you make a million parts per year, then if you\u2019ve only solved failures at the 1 in 1000 level, that means you\u2019re going to ship 1000 defective parts a year. That means angry customers who will cancel or not pay on any hard won orders. It takes a long time to discover, root cause, then fix failure modes. Solving them often increases cost. And too often, you discover failure modes that can\u2019t be fixed and if severe enough, it might kill the entire product."

You can get one made offshore for 2,500-10 grand depending on the geometry and if any coring/slides are needed. As long as you aren't used an abrasive material like filled nylon you could likely get 50k shots out of it, worst case scenario you weld and remachine the parting line that gets washed out Don't even waste time and money with 3d printing molds, the technology just isn't there yet. Places like protolabs are good options but expensive in comparison to the Chinese. \u00a0Where I work we have used mold bases we offer to clients, they just have to pay for the cavities to be machined and an ejector plate to be drilled, cuts costs drastically for them. Reaching out to local molding companies might be able to reduce costs 50k isn't feasible but if you wanted to make say 200 prototypes you can cast epoxy/urethanes into silicone molds",
        "\"Affordable\" is a dangerous word in injection molding \u2013 it's a classic case of where short-term savings can backfire spectacularly. Balancing upfront cost with your long-term vision is crucial. Let's unpack your options: - 3D-printed molds: Fantastic for quick proofs-of-concept with intricate geometries. However, they lack the durability for 50k shots, even with the best print settings. Consider this if you're still in early-stage design flux and need rapid iterations. - DIY silicone molds: Unbeatably cheap and good for very basic shapes in truly small batches. If your part is extremely simple and you only need a handful to test, this could work. But remember: flexible molds often lead to inconsistent part quality. - CNC-machined aluminum molds: Here's your sweet spot potential. Aluminum offers decent durability, handles detail reasonably well, and provides a more predictable molding experience. This is where you start getting into \"real\" prototype tooling, suitable for design validation and small test runs. But here's the thing: no one method is inherently superior. Which \"affordable\" is right depends on these factors: - Part Complexity: Lots of undercuts? Thin walls? That eliminates DIY immediately. - Plastic Material: Some resins are notoriously abrasive, chewing through weaker molds. - Fidelity Requirements: Are these prototypes strictly for functionality, or do you need aesthetics too? Don't think of this as a one-time decision. Prototyping with cheaper methods can inform a more efficient design for your final, higher-volume mold."

        "It reduces the voltage so that you don't get ginormous input currents flowing through the tank. At resonance, the effective load is at a minimum and maximum current will flow through the tank. If the tank was exposed to the full 320V instead of 1/20th, imagine what current you'd have flowing. Other than that theres no point in the transformer(as far as i know). In fact, using the principle of impedance reflection, you could eliminate the transformer all together, by reflecting the LC tank to the primary side: Zreflected = (20/1)\\^2*Zload. The reflected load would be 20^2 bigger and hence the current that much smaller.",
        "The point of this circuit is in delivering power to the load. Note that the load is not explicitly shown in this schematics. If you wanted to model this circuit, you would have to add a load resistance in series with the \"Work Coil\". Presumably this load resistance is quite small, so to deliver good power to it, the current oscillating in the LC tank has to be quite large. For good efficiency, you want most of the power to go to the load, and not to be wasted elsewhere. This brings up the question of the impedance of the circuit which supplies power to the tank. Without the transformer, the channel resistance of the MOSFETs would be seeing exactly the same current as the load, and therefore a lot of power would be dissipated in the MOSFETs, unless their channel resistances are negligible comparing to the load resistance. The transformer reduces this effect 400 times (20^(2)). Note that even though impedance matching is a great concept in very many applications, there are some caveats when applying it to this particular circuit. You are not really matching the impedances in this case. Impedance matching maximizes the power to the load for a given input voltage. That is not what is optimized in this circuit. Specifically, you can simulate this circuit replacing the MOSFETs with ideal, zero impedance switches, (or even easier, replacing the whole left side with an AC voltage source), and the power will be flowing to the load just fine --without any explicit impedance matching between the zero impedance source and the finite impedance load. In this case, changing the transformer ratio would simply change the current swing and how much power the source is driving into the load. In practice, with the real MOSFETs chosen for a specific primary side voltage, you still do not match their impedances to those of the load -- you do not want half of the power to be lost in MOSFETs. What you do \"match\" instead, is the current that you need to see at the load with what the MOSFETs can do without unacceptable losses. Choose a lower transformer ratio, the power to the load goes up, but MOSFET losses go up even steeper. Choose a higher transformer ratio, and the power to the load goes down, while the losses also go down. So you coordinate the choice of the supply voltage, of the MOSFETs, and of the transformer ratio to get the required power to the load at a required efficiency."

        "There are a lot of ampacity tables for different conditions. You an also look up the fusing current for a wire. This is the current which will cause the wire to melt completely. All of these tables have to make assumptions about ambient temp, etc. But the ampacity for 14 AWG in chassis wiring is 32 amps. The fusing current for 14 AWG is about 160 Amps. So I guess that is kind of your solution space if you are willing to let the wire get really hot. The melting temperature of copper is over 1000 C which is almost 2000 F. So you will probably need your magic insulation. Since we are off in fantasy land, let's run the wire through a snug fitting hole in solid diamond. Or better yet, lets drill a hole in the diamond (LOL) and cast the conductor in place in the hole. Now you have the most thermally conductive material known to science as a heatsink and insulator for your wire. I bet you can get way more than 160 amps through it before it melts. Thermal expansion will be a bitch, though. But it is hard to decide which parts of reality to ignore in these scenarios.",
        "I mean if we're really going to the extreme, copper still conducts pretty well when it's a liquid, so as long as your insulation can hold the liquid copper this gives you quite a lot of extra temperature headroom. The resistivity roughly doubles, but at 1800K it's going to be able to shed a lot of heat very quickly - so depending on the exact scenario this might give peak current capacity.",
        "an important part of the question you don\u2019t mention: how long does it have to last? Putting \u201dmaximum power\u201d through a wire for 10 seconds before destruction is going to be a very different answer than \u201cmaximum power\u201d for a day, versus \u201cmaximum power\u201c for an indefinite amount of time.",
        "You can certainly get high temperature fiber insulation, it used to be asbestos and won't melt. Problem is the bare conductor can radiate and convect away a lot more heat than an insulated wire, so the insulated wire still can't carry as much current and the conductor will run hotter than the bare one.",
        "It's a heat problem. This heat problem has many factors that define if a current level is...uh...sustainable. The wire itself has certain construction, and in turn that wire as certain standardized ratings. Any termination you put onto that wire has their own ratings and capabilities. There can also be inherent risks of the connection type that may generate reliability issues. When you connect a wire to a device, a component of the electrical system, that component has its own ratings for current carrying capacity, temp rating, etc. The environment all this electrical stuff is packaged in has certain peak temperature ranges that may require you to derate the conductors, components, fuses, breakers, etc. so they can still safely work at elevated environmental temperatures. You might shove a pile of wires through a small conduit, and that bundle of wires all carrying current and dumping heat also have derating characteristics based on how many are shoved into that space in close proximity to each other. ALL of this stuff combines together in an aggregate electrical code, a literal book, that tells everyone working with electrical what is deemed safe based on a whole variety of factors. In part, this electric code of national usage is applied in a way that attempts to design to the weakest link of the system and to account for external variables. This national electrical code, tells you what the current carrying capacity of a 14GA wire (of a specific type, of a specific application and installation) is. A wire of its own volition will have a higher rating. When applied to an application, the recommended current limit is generally much lower. An important note to critically understand, and why electric code is written the way it is, once you connect a wire of AMAZING performance characteristics to another component, that other component is the weak point. You have a cool wire that will survive 1000\u00b0C operation? Neat. Now crimp on a terminal that can't, connect it to a contactor that can't, and that wire rating means jack. This is exactly why electric code caters to the lowest common denominator, often 75\u00b0C, regardless of what the actual item is speced for. So now here's a 14GA wire that carries all of 15A which may also be derated if it's running bundled through conduit, used in a hot environment, etc. With deratings, maybe that 14GA wire only handles 10A, or 8A. The wire might be speced for vastly higher, but that doesn't matter, not when you're building for the system as a whole.",
        "Lots of answers here explaining that 14 awg can handle a lot of current, much more than most tables would suggest, especially with some sort of cooling setup. But one thing that\u2019s also important is the voltage drop over a long wire. Just because 14 awg can handle a lot of current, doesn\u2019t mean that it will perform okay at any length. At 100 amps and 28 volts on a 25 foot, 14 awg wire, you\u2019re losing half your voltage and your wire is essentially a big resistor, even tho the temperature has gotten nowhere near the limits of the wire. If we change it to 1 ft of the wire, then there are no voltage issues as the drop becomes tiny. So sometimes, if we\u2019re talking about power transmission and long runs of wire, the main limitation is moreso that the wire can no longer support the voltage. It can handle the current thermally, but it just becomes a big resistor and isn\u2019t useful as part of a circuit. If it had any real length to it, you would have to jack the voltage way up to even get to the situation you\u2019re talking about. Chassis wiring with short runs is where you start reaching thermal limitations as the voltage drop isn\u2019t a big deal anymore. And that\u2019s when the other answers apply saying that it would melt.",
        "Another random comment - Current always generates a magnetic field.\u00a0 If you put way too much current into a wire it can twist up before it melts. If you've ever\u00a0hooked up two batteries in parallel, but accidentally with the wrong polarity, you know the\u00a0jump the wires do before they turn into smoke and flaming balls of copper.",
        "There is Copperweld which is copper clad aluminum. On ceramic insulators from Gamma and no insulation you should be able to run 200 C easily. Some utilities do this with AAC (all aluminum conductors) already. I\u2019ve even used MI cable capable of over 1000 C ambient in a foundry feeding a motor. But sticking with just TFE #14 (fire alarm cable) it is rated for 45 A. Note also there\u2019s a bit of a delay before most cables melt so you can easily go very high if \u201ccontinuous\u201d isn\u2019t needed. Realistically you\u2019re better off with rods or tubes of say nickel superalloys which can operate up to 1000 C without melting and just rely on say 1/2\u201d or 3/4\u201d tubing which also inherently handles much higher currents.",
        "That depends on the thermal conductivity of your fictional insulation, the ignition temperature of whatever it's in contact with, what is around it, if whatever is around it is flowing, how fast it's flowing if so, how much of it there is, what it's heat capacity is, what is around the surrounding substance, etc. Vague theoreticals don't work with engineering, we provide good enough approximations that solve real, specific problems.

        "Water has to flow downhill to operate a lock. You can do it in multiple stages with retention ponds to reduce the amount of water needed, but locks do work and water flowing downhill is what provides the energy for that work. They could put in pumps and pump the water back up to the reservoir, but that's a lot of infrastructure and energy needed. It might be cost effective to build water-carrying canals to increase the size of the watershed. I bet they've looked at that. It is rough terrain.",
        "The way a canal lock works is that it drains hundreds of thousands of tons of water at a higher level in the lock out into the ocean until the level in the canal matches the level in the ocean. Then it opens the doors and the ship floats in. Then water drains into the lock from a lake or river or other source at a higher level into the lock basin until the ship floats up. In the case of New Panamax, they're floating 120,000 ton ships up 85 feet (26m). The chambers are 110 ft (33.5m) wide by 1,050 ft (320m) long with a draft of almost 40 feet (12m). If it was a single stage, that's a change in volume of almost 280,000 tons of water. All\\* that weight is currently moved for free by gravity. That's naively assuming a single lock station, there are 3 locks on each side, some with water-saving basins. See here for more info: This is done to reduce water usage. But no, just pumping 280,000 tons of water back uphill into the lake for each ship is not feasible.",
        "Reusing water in the Panama canal means pumping all the water back up that you sent down. You're basically trying to run a river backwards. Each lock requires ~100k m^3 of water to fill (which is 10^8 kg). Each 'series' of locks raises more than 10m so I'll got with that number just to keep things simple. Moving that much water that far, against gravity, requires ~2.5 MWh. Now multiply that by 10k transits a year, and you're looking at 20-30 GWh per year. That's a sizeable fraction of the output of a power plant. And that's just the \"101 level\" physics, ignoring friction and all sorts of other losses. And there's 3 lock complexes. So basically, simply pumping the water back up would be incredibly costly. I've seen some 'tricks' proposed that can *conserve* water (basically having a runoff tank; when you empty a lock you can basically store the top 'half' of the water at a middle elevation, then use it to fill the lower 'half' of the lock), but that still uses gravity rather than pumping. Reducing the water needed per transit seems a lot more 'viable' than just going all Tim Taylor on it.",
        "Yes. I was just thinking about this. Install turbines to generate power as water flows downhill through the locks. Use that power, plus some additional power, to pump the water back uphill instead of dumping it to the ocean. During the 2019 droughts, traffic, and revenue, was halved for a period of time because panama also needs the water for irrigation and drinking. Climate change could make this more frequent. You would only need to do this during drought times so the energy generated wouldn't need to be spent on pumping. It could be sold. Water needs for the public are going to increase. International shipping is going to increase. Weather instability is going to increase. Energy costs are going to increase. It's only a matter of time before this makes financial sense.",
        "I too thought it was ridiculous that they don't simply pump the water back up but after doing some back of the napkin calculations I can see the problem... It's not the power consumption, considering since pumped hydro can achieve efficiencies of 70 to 80% (possibly as high as 87%) - It's the size of the infrastructure needed. It takes 50,000,000 gallons of water to fill a lock and a lock can be filled in 10 minutes. I assume that is what is needed in order to maintain the 36 ships per day upper limit. That is that means you would need to pump the water back up into a lock at an incredible rate of 600,000,000 gallons of water per hour! A typical US nuclear reactor for example uses pumps that can each move 100,000 gallons of water per minute. But even that large amount only equates to just 6,000,000 gallons of water per hour, which is only 1% of the water volume needed, meaning the Panama canal would need 100 of these pumps! The hp rating of these pumps is between 4.5 and 7.5MW Multiplied by 100 that equals 450 to 750MW. So that's how much power would be needed to power the pumps when they are in use, which would presumably be most of the time. So lets go with the high estimate of 750MW, times a low pump hydro efficiency rating of 70%, times that by two since you're going to need one set of pumps for each side of the locks, that gives a high estimate of 450MW of power generation. Although this seems to be larger than any currently existing powerplant in Panama today, a single large scale natural gas generator like GE's h-class-gas-turbines can easily provide the power needed. Panama also recently just built a 381MW gas power plant. Getting back to the infrastructure problem, the biggest pumps in the world would seem to be the IJmuiden pumping station pump which can pump 50,000 liters per second, that equals 47,500,000 gallons per hour. You would need at least 12 of these for each side (east and west so 24 in total), plus probably a few more for redundancies. In fairness the IJmuiden pumping station has 6 of these pumps already, so Panama's canals installation would only be about twice as large. Clearly it's doable, but it would take a lot of capital to buy 30 of the largest pumps in the world, install them and build a powerplant just for them plus the needed transmission lines. So for now they go with the \"hope and pray\" it rains method instead. Also in fairness there's the salt water contamination of Lake Gutan problem too."

After 5-10 years, company A decides to upgrade the widget to a new family of widget. After 5 years of new widget production, the old design is effectively obsolete. Company A won't want to give away even an obsolete design for free, and it won't retain it indefinitely. So, Company A will file those old plans away. If Company A goes out of business, or survives an extended period of time, eventually those schematics won't be worth the paper they are printed on. So Company A will dispose of them.

A customer would call us going hey I got such and such motor and the mounting base is abc123 I need another one with the same base but higher HP or rpm or whatever. Well we would go to this room with 100k of old microfiche and look up that base number and find the specs then go cross reference it to what we offer and get it sold. Long story short it would take years for a small team of folks to make digital copies of it so it never happened. So my best guess is that a lot of those copies are in old storage rooms and have been forgotten about or damaged and never scanned and put online due to cost and no profitable need to do so. Or last time they were scanned and cataloged it was stored on something so obsolete it is hard to retrieve without good reason.

My point is, a lot of this stuff does exist, and if you just want \"generic blueprint of something\", that isn't too hard to find. The hard part is if you want a blueprint of a *specific* thing. That can be much harder to find. In general, the easiest things to find blueprints for will be: 1. Public buildings and infrastructure, or anything designed by the government (can be requested by public records request) 2. Large private buildings in large cities (may be required to file a set of plans with the city or state) 3. Things that have a devoted modeling community (tanks, planes, ships, cars, steam trains, etc.) Unfortunately, a lot of drawings have been lost, destroyed, misfiled, or misplaced. Most aren't available online. Many are poorly indexed. You may need to go to an archive personally, or pay the archive to search for you.

Boss was like \"Why are we keeping the plans for a 90 year old toaster? Throw 'em out!\" There is little chance any of this is on the web unless it was a public entity that had to publish its plans. There are a number of government entities whose bid packages are public domain or publicly available, hardly any really old plans are preserved digitally outside private collections within institutions or companies.",

Probably not on the internet, you'd have to go to the right office. Boeing has scanned in a lot of their old mylar drawings. Access to that database is heavily restricted. They keep the original mylar somewhere climate controlled. They also have engineering stress notes going way back (I know because I once tracked down a 787 design detail that originated on the 707, and carried over through the 747 and 777). It costs money to store things, especially before everything went digital. Anything without legal retention requirements tends to get scrapped. Anything with trade secrets gets destroyed. It also costs money to scan things. Particularly anything with dimensional accuracy. We had many mylar sheets scanned in for a program, and they had special scanners that could reproduce the scale accurately (these types of blueprints don't have dimensions, the drawings are 1:1). Museums cannot afford that.",
        "Uh, you absolutely can, you just need to know where to look. It can take decades to track down drawing resources for a given project. Digitization is a severely limiting factor, and only a small fraction of all drafted materials ultimately survive, but I guarantee you, there is MUCH more stuff out there than you realize.",
        "it takes work to setup something like that. time and money, and there isn't much value in doing it. Sure, a few people would have fun browsing through it, but that isn't exactly justifying all that work. Also, there is far more to making something complex work than just simply having all the individual part drawings. Lets say company X made an engine. The first set of drawings released didn't even make a functional engine, it was a prototype. out of the 200 pieces, 100 of them had to be modified before the thing even fit together. so now half the drawings have a revision. Then another 50 parts were revised to further improve it. Then another 10 to work out the last few kinks. Then a supplier went out of business so they had to modify 10 parts because one of the parts had to change due to the new supplier's capabilities and the surrounding parts had to accommodate. Then they decided to reduce cost by changing another 20 parts. So, there are now all these drawings with all these revisions, and you don't even know if you have the newest revisions or perhaps some of the drawings were too faded or damaged to archive. How do you know out of the 200 parts, where most of them have a few different revisions, which of them fit together to actually make a functional engine? one wrong revision of a part and the whole thing wont work. Better hope you have every single drawing as well as all of the assembly instructions, and that you have all the right custom tools and fixtures to setup to assemble it properly.",
        "There is no profit in saving all the old drawings. I am overjoyed when we find original drawings for facilities I am retrofitting/ repurposing/ modifying. Usually we have to perform significant investigation to determine the capacity of the existing foundations, pads, and building systems in existing facilities. For me those old drawings are GOLD- but building owners don't understand and don't care. Some industries are better than others- but most are lousy.",
        "One page is one thing, but I have seen machines that have a thicker drawing set than most buildings. Every sprocket and cog gets its own drawing that trees into the final assembly. Now you have hundreds of millions of pages of hand drawings that can be scanned one sheet at a time, but for what purpose? If the machine is no longer in commission, then it would be really expensive for someone to scan obsolete prints, then there\u2019s the whole issue of hosting them on some website where they can be searchable. Why would anyone care? Scanners haven\u2019t been around for very long compared to the time we have been creating drawings. There\u2019s been about 250 years for stuff to get misplaced and destroyed."

      "output": [
        "You choose a 1\u201d screw for a reason. Running a fastener under its standard torque means the fastener will be subjected to higher bending loads in complex loading if it exists in the application. Preload is your friend here. Essentially you need to understand why you choose 1\u201d. Is this joint under complex loading? Purely a shear joint and you just need the shear area of the shank? Single shear, double shear?  Tension only?  There is not enough info to answer the question. Obviously bolt material also matters immensely if you are talking dirtball grade 8 up to high strength carbon steels like 15-5 or 13-8 and everything in between",
        "I can\u2019t really address your question because I don\u2019t know the application. If you\u2019re trying to get a lot of preload (ie, sealing a flange) then of course your torque matters a lot. What I can say for sure is that you absolutely can get the right torque. You need to get a tool called a \u201ctorque multiplier\u201d and put the biggest boy(s) you have in the shop on it.  If this is a production process that you are going to repeat over and over again, you should be using a hydraulic bolt tensioner.",
        "So the physics of a screw are super\u2026weird\u2026 Here\u2019s a great video. But in essence the strength of a bolted joint is the total force the bolt can exert to the bolted surfaces through its tensile strength. If no force is actually stretching the bolt, compressing the surfaces, the joint is weakened. If it\u2019s simply \u201cenough force is exerted on the bolted surfaces but not as much as the bolt calls for\u201d it\u2019s fine but if it\u2019s \u201cmore force will be exerted on the bolted surfaces than the tensile force exerted by the bolt\u201d it WONT be fine Hope this helps!",
        "What grade bolt are you using? I mostly work with B7 studs instead of bolts, which fall between a grade 5 and grade 8 bolt in strength rating. Why did you select that specific torque? 12,500 in-lbs is almost exactly the yield limit for an unlubricated 1\"-8 B7 stud. That is the maximum torque it is rated to take before it fails. It will fail at an even lower torque if you use an anti-seize lubricant. (Using a lubricant will also let you reach your target pre-load with less torque required.)",
        "If they can't hit the torque, they are not the shop for you. Outsource it if you need to. Torque multipliers are also very handy tools. I just tightened a 1\"bolt to ~12,000 in-lbf a few days back just testing stuff. It wasn't hard at all. I had a three foot torque wrench I had to apply 250 ft-lbf to meet torque. That's about 90lbf force at the handle. With a 4x multiplier braced on another bolt it was done. Easy stuff.",
        "Torque in a bolt gets converted into a compression force from the bolt head and nut, and a tension force within the bolt itself. Smaller bolts take lower torques because they will yield before you can torque them enough, so you use bigger bolts to apply more force to the two parts you are fastening to each other. This provides a normal force between two pieces of metal that generates a sufficient friction force to hold a shear load. I'm assuming you did a calculation at some point that said 'Based on the loads I'm applying, to prevent these two pieces of metal from moving, I need to apply this much torque to the bolts, times a safety factor' If you did that calculation (which you should have done) then you can plug in whatever torque you want to it and see how it affects things."

      "output": [
        "That kind of setup uses a freewheel on each side of the rear hub, where each chain connects to drive the rear wheel. You are right that both people need to be pedaling at exactly the same speed for both to be doing work and contributing to propulsion. If one person is peddling just slightly slower, they won't be contributing any work. But thinking of it that way can distract you from understanding how it really works. It's actually easy and normal for both people to be pedaling perfectly synchronized, both helping propel the bike. I think that the best way to understand that is go back to thinking about a normal one person bicycle. The bicycle has a lot of momentum, and will be traveling at roughly a steady speed over one revolution of the pedals. The person pedaling has to turn the pedals exactly in sync with that motion. If they are turning the pedals at 55 RPM when it would take 60 RPM to match the speed of the bike, the freewheel mechanism will just be spinning and they won't be contributing anything to moving the bike forward. So how is it possible that ordinary people can ride a bike without studying and practicing to exactly synchronize the speed of their pedaling to the speed of the bike? Well, you just push on the pedals, and if you are going slower than matching the speed of the bike, they move freely without any effort and catch up to where they are synchronized with the motion of the bike. It's like when you put something down on the table. You don't have to precisely position the bottom of the object to within a fraction of a millimeter to get it there. You just move it down until it bumps into the table and there you go. So you just pedal forward and the crank spin easily until, clunk, the freewheel engages, and you are pushing against the inertia of the bike and helping propel it forward. That happens easily with barely any thought or maybe no thought anytime somebody rides a bicycle. If you think of the tandem with the separate drives as two people each synchronizing with the motion of the bicycle, the same way an individual person would be synchronizing with the motion of the single bicycle, there's nothing more special or tricky about making it work with two people doing the same thing, any more than if you had two people riding separate bicycles side by side.",
        "If the person \"not doing any work\" is *trying* to help, their legs will speed up cadence until they \"find\" resistance. I think there might be a misunderstanding that the brain says \"pedal at 60rpm\" and the legs do that speed regardless of resistance. It's more like the brain says \"pedal this hard\" and the cadence gets determined by gearing, slope, weight etc. Tandems (typically) couple the captain and stoker cranks so that they are both fixed to each other *and* the crank angles are identical. If the crank angles are offset then foot collisions could occur. There can be other setups but that is the default.

Basically brake shoes attached to the spinning core through springs, that when they spin fast enough press against an outer drum. Same concept is used in a centrifugal *clutch*, as found in chainsaws and mopeds - at idle speeds the shoes are pulled in and disengage, but as the motor speeds up they're slung out to engage with a drum. Those are cheap and easy to find, may be able to repurpose one as a brake for your project depending on speed and torque needs. Eddy current brakes are much cooler though (literally) - probably much better for if you're trying to dissipate power continuously.",
        "Are these machines hard limited to a certain speed or \"soft-limited\" meaning it takes ever greater amounts of force to keep acceleration but there isn't a true hard limit? The reason I ask is because I suspect some of these work out devices may work like a rowing machine, which uses the fluid friction of a fly wheel in a tank of liquid to produce resistance. It doesn't have a hard limit, but friction will be an exponential factor of your velocity meaning it increases rapidly and the acceleration is tempered by the need to accelerate the mass of the water.",

I'd wager you could pack any kind of roller or ball bearing with the stuff and get a good result -- assuming you could seal it.",
        "A centrifugal governor mechanically actuating a brake might work? It'd be pretty easy to adjust, and if the brake is oversized enough, should have a pretty firm limit. Depending on what energy is put into the rotation, it might be dissipating a fair bit of heat if operated at the top rotation speed though. I'm thinking on the scale of an old style engine governor (two steel balls spinning around) and a cable operated bicycle disc brake.",
        "So, a lot of people have talked about eddy current and centrifugal brakes, so I won't as they are good options, but I want to ask a few questions: * Can you go over the specified rotational speed for a short time as long as it settles on the spec? Also, start to think about how tight your spec requirement is. * Are you using an electric motor as a power source? If you've answered 'Yes' to those, you may consider a variable frequency drive and PID controller, effectively using software to control your speed. This is one of the cornerstones of embedded controls. Also, the cool thing about using PID controllers with eddy current brakes is that the brake can be adjusted. Specifically, if you have an eddy current brake that uses an electromagnet instead of a permanent magnet. This is still generally an gross oversimplification, but you get the idea."

        "Prospects is basically zero. Transitioning a CRW is one of the most difficult aerodynamic challenge and the industry threw 30 years of work at it and basically all the resources at it (Full scale WT test at Ames, 2 sub scale flying prototypes). Even with the cards stacked for it, the thing never manage to transition to forward flight. I have a colleague who got on to that program near the tail end of it and the technical challenge remaining with CRW is still daunting. Even if they manage to transition to forward flight, a real full scale aircraft is still not guaranteed to work. The biggest problem with scaling up is the increase in size, weight and thus inertia of the rotor... all that inertia you need to stop when you transition from hovering to forward flight. It's a problem that will only grow exponentially with size due to square-cube law. There's no relevant advantages over Tilt-rotors like V-22s so once that has been flying regularly so it's why CRW program was canceled and the idea set aside and is unlikely to come back without some breakthrough in material sciences.",
        "I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say the biggest limiting factor here will be pilot willingness and availability. Staying current on one aircraft type is work enough but adding in something that potentially has a whole new set of procedures for flight regimes that simply don\u2019t exist in traditional fixed or rotorwing craft is going to be a nonstarter. Especially to qualify into a niche that is already reasonably well served by traditional craft. The US military has arguably infinite budget, will, and choice of pilot prospects and there were still plenty of pilot error crashes with the Osprey. Remember, a huge part of the whole 737 max fiasco was simply not wanting to retrain pilots and that was just slapping new engines on a decades old airframe design."

But if it is milled with two or more shots you will have a problem and you cannot predict which side will be higher. In that case you should grind the surface. The reason are cutting conditions: the forces change and thus the cut changes constatntly. The best i could achieve was 0.005mm on a surface without holes or anything. Especially casted parts have changing yoeld strength.",

If you need them within half a micron of each other, that's a different story than if they need to be within 50 microns. In the latter case any mill will be able to easily meet that requirement just by co-machining those surfaces. You are also free to add a callout like \"must not be proud of A-datum.\" Throw an inspection flag on there too if you need it. Also have to ask, given the requirements, why would you *not* machine these in the same operation? Seems like the easiest way to achieve what you're after, unless being proud by a few microns would actually be an issue.",

I agree with the advice to lower the hub to the middle of your tolerance zone if flatness over the entire plane isn't good enough.",

      "output": [
        "Okay so, with engine sounds in general. Firing order is not really what matters. What matters is the interval between explosions, and the firing order can sometimes affect that. The best example of that is the american crossplane V8 compared to the european flat plane V8. V12 is essentially two i6 put together. But. interval between explosions can be modified by changing the V's angle, and this will definitely change the sound the engine makes. The pitch of an engine entirely depends on how many explosions it makes in a turn, and what is its RPM. For 4 stroke engines, simply take the RPM, multiply it by its cylinder count, and divide it by 4. This will give you the pitch of the engine. However, if you truly want to replicate the sound, it will be impossible for most engines as you cannot change the intervals between explosions, that are present on any V(or W) engines. You would essentially need two inline 6 engines to make the same sound as a V12. Anyway, The Pagani Hyura)s engine is the Mercedes-AMG M158 (basically a M275). It is a 60\u00b0 V12. And most importantly, it's an even firing engine (like a lot of modern engines). This means that yes, a i6 could in theory replicate its sound, but there is one problem: RPM. The redline is around 5'800RPM on the V-12 I believe. This would mean you need a i6 capable of doing 11'600rpm to make the same sound. The problem is that little to no i6 can manage that without being HEAVILY modified, and we are talking about racing engines that have a lifespan shorter than your average hamster in the wild. But what if. What if we looked not at car engines. But something smaller. Something lighter that would not separate itself in half once its RPM reach 5 digits. *Bike Engines*. The Honda CBX reaches 9'000RPM, and it may be easier to make it reach the 11'600 we want. There may be other engines to be checked, it's up to you now."

As far as your question on coil numbers, have you tried checking your EE department professors or grad students? There should be a class on electricity and magnetism.

We came up with the solution of utilizing a known stall torque on an electric motor in combination with a given force.

If the vibration pushes it in it won\u2019t really apply much torque and if you get the vibration right it will back out. Screws don\u2019t unscrew because the friction is enough to hold it. Usually that happens because the joint is under compression and the screw is stretched but cycling of forces (temperature, pressure, very high vibes) can make it slowly walk. The usual answer is to just add more friction, either through a nylon insert that gets cut and deformed by the thread, a little plastic nub applied to the thread, or for hot conditions a distortion on the nut (they are squished into an oval) or the thread (the threads are pushed appart with a punch). the vibratory drill will not add much torque to the thread so it only works on broken or already loose screws."

        "They're not _directly_ mechanically connected. In most cars, they connect through a hydraulic pump that serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it ensures proper delivery of appropriate pressure to each brake, multiplies the force of your soft pedal push, and enables things like anti-lock, which is typically done by pulsing the pressure so the brakes are not just tightly grabbed on and locked to the disc or wheel. But, there's an important reason why they're not _completely_ mechanically detached. What if that pump fails? What if the engine fails? You only lose partial functionality of the brakes, in those cases, because you can still apply pressure that will make it to the brakes. It will just take a lot more force on your part. That kind of failure mode is definitely preferred for a common consumer machine that can kill people, rather than the failure mode of an all-electronic solution with no mechanical coupling that leaves you without brakes or, if it fails \"closed,\" suddenly applies brakes on the freeway, causing you to lose control and very likely causing a nasty collision or pileup.",

The exception being air brakes on Trucks, but those are pushed shutby spring pressure and held open by compressed air for that exact same reason.

If it goes through your heart you\u2019re probably dead. If it goes through your legs, then it depends on the resistance of your body how much damage is done or if it\u2019s fatal.",

I\u2019ve built a coilgun with those big 450V ones and I had to be extra careful, the sparks they create if shorted are already very scary For your second question, while in serie their voltage add up, two 10 volt capacitors create a 20 volt potential. If you put them in parallel their capacity add up and voltage stay the same"

      "output": [
        "Other options are flat/rectangle, square, octogon, decagon....etc, on to infinity (a circular nut). flat can only accept a wrench at two positions. square/rectangle can accept a wrength at four positions. Octogon and above can accept a wrench at many positions, but tool contact area is low. A circular nut can accept a wrench at an infinite number of positions but with a minimum of tool contact area (assuming a spanner type wrench). You might try to get clever and say \"why not use circular nuts and a tube-type wrench to maximize contact area\"? And you would be very silly because this disregards the possibility that any type of liquid or lubrication could be on the nut. A wrench designed to clamp on a circular nut would also be needlessly complex to build and operate. Hexagon is a good compromise between tool contact area and available positions at which a wrench can be placed to torque the nut.",
        "Hexagons are bestagons There\u2019s two competing factors. The more sides there are, the less swing room is needed. But the wider the sides are, the tighter you can make the nut. And add on top, you want an even number so that a wrench can have parallel sides. So with four sides you have the strongest arrangement. But you have to swing a full 90 degrees minimum on each stroke. Six sides is marginally weaker with shorter sides, but only needs 60 degrees per swing of the wrench. Significant difference. Now eight sides - weaker still, and we get 45 degrees needed per swing. An improvement, but only half the improvement of going from four sides to six. There is a pattern. As sides increase, the amount of flexibility we gain for each \u2018step\u2019 decreases. But the strength we lose keeps going up. Eventually it\u2019s not worth it. The balance point seems to have settled on six - the greatest gain in flexibility with the minimum loss of strength. All of this assumes the same amount of material (cost) per nut.",
        "It\u2019s a compromise between tool access and resistance to damage and rounding out. A square nut is a lot harder to round out than a hexagonal nut, but can only be accessed every 90 degrees. An octagonal nut can be accessed every 45 degrees, but it\u2019s a lot easier to round out than a hex nut. Square nuts are also widely available if you wanted to use them.",
        "Hexagonal nuts are the best compromise between clearance, multiple turning angles, and ease of manufacturing. It's easier to manufacture a square head, but that requires more clearance to turn and does not increase the load capacity of the fastener. 12 point fasteners decrease the clearance required and have the same load capacity as hexagonal fasteners, but are much more difficult to manufacture. The load capacity of most fasteners is not dependent on the head design, but on the material, thread design, and diameter. Typical fasteners will fail the bolt or stud material before the nut or threads fail."

I don't know the math and while I can look this up from here, he didnt have documentation. I would probably have better luck building a simple transmitter, you'd need to scrounge a crystal oscillator and an appropriately sized resistor, the rest you could make from salvaged wire. Then you could potentially send out some morse code.",
        "It all depends on the radio and the power supply in it. Many modern switching power supplies will actually run from DC, though it is not universal. A lot of modern electronics also have a wide input voltage range, and sometime operate to some extent out of that range. So if you were \\*really\\* lucky you may have been able to put the batteries in series and broadcast with probably some degradation in power. Second best case is that the guts of the radio actually work at or near 12 or 24VDC, and you can stick that across the low voltage bus in the radio and power it. Overvoltage by too much will cook parts, under voltage by too much and you have reduced, or no performance. With older tube radios you were probably screwed unless they were designed to also run off of 12 or 24VDC. Transformers work great with AC but only for the very first pulse of DC. Tubes also stepped the voltage up, not down, they are high voltage devices. As an aside it is fun watching kids who are used to low voltage solid state stuff work on \"simple\" tube guitar amps. With low voltage stuff you can be pretty sloppy about what you touch Anyway, the long and short is it takes more doing to make high voltage from DC, Now, some old tube ham transceivers did have a means of working off of 12V, it was usually a big plug in brick. In the semiconductor era they had a couple of transistors to chop the DC up so it could be put through a transformer. In the way old days they used vibrators. No, get your mind out of the gutter! These were essentially buzzers with extra contacts for chopping up the low voltage DC into AC that could be ran into a transformer. I would say with a tube set that is 120V only your going down with the ship.",

What would happen if you hooked up the 24v battery to the ignition coil & shorted a sparkplug to the antenna from the radio? (Do Aircraft engines even use sparkplugs?) Try that with cold numb hands, trauma & probably a head injury. The options nowadays are pretty amazing, from satellite phones to personal radio beacons."

The mAh number for that battery is the same as for a single cell. In both cases the Wh (or mWh) number for the battery will be the same.

At something like 15 km deep you hit the ductile brittle transition... Above this the rock is rigid and does not flow. The deeper you go, the stiffer the rock due to the weight of the rock above you. Below this level, the stiffness of the rock decreases and it flows. The transition zone represents the stiffest part of the earth, where pressure and stiffness are at a maximum. Fluids (magma, water, etc) have a hard time getting through this region. so do drill holes. The depth of the Kola hole where they hit trouble is in this zone. Once you get past that zone the drilling should be easier but the hole will close up. Keeping it open would be a monumentally difficult engineering feat. Think of a refractory ceramic that can withstand those pressures and temperatures without deforming. There are some. You'd have to line the hole with something like that then keep it constantly cooled. I suspect the amount of fluid required to remove enough heat from that region... as well as the rest of the hole... would be infeasible... you could not physically push that much liquid down the hole fast enough to keep it cool enough to not close. The pressure at that depth is the minimum pressure you'd have to pump.

        "Think of a network like a fortress. Their IT department does everything they can to limit what comes into their network. Most sensitive systems can't even be accessed from outside the 'walls' of the network. A VPN creates a 'tunnel' through the Internet that only opens at your computer and inside their network. When you are connected to the VPN, all traffic coming to or from your computer is forced through this tunnel. The only way for anyone to access your computer is by accessing their fortress and getting to your tunnel. That means you're protected by all of their network defenses and can be considered inside the network for security purposes. If a bad guy wanted to use your system to gain access to protected information, it is generally as difficult as if the computer was inside their offices. For that reason you can access those sensitive systems that are blocked from outside access. Also, that means they can track your Internet usage as well as if you were in their office. VPNs that people use for privacy function the same, but their focus is on the fact that anyone tracking you will get to your VPN provider, but won't be able to track further than that. A privacy focused VPN will not tell them where the other end of the tunnel is, so they can't track the user. The VPN owner can still track all of your Internet usage though, so make certain you trust them."

      "output": [
        "Heli blade designer here. Some designs employ an anhedral tip which is effectively a winglet. The advantages are increased hover efficiency and improvements in vortex shedding at the tips. The disadvantage is decreased cruise efficiency due to increases in drag and it complicates the blade manufacture a little bit. For a particular helicopter, it may be a design that needs a little more hover efficiency or cruise efficiency depending on what you want it to do, so you may choose a different tip. The planform shape of the tip is ultimately much more important and the solution space is vast, which is why you see so many variations in the industry amongst modern aircraft. Small/light/cheap aircraft will typically just have a square tip because cost is king and performance may be secondary.",
        "Very generally, winglets add less lift than if you used that material to extend the lifting body. They get used on commercial jets because airports want to limit width to park more planes next to each other. In most other cases, it\u2019s cheaper and lighter to make the lifting surface longer.",
        "Drag is not a huge issue for helicopters and their blades nearly as much as it is for a plane flying near mach at the same AoA and speed for hours at a time where profit margins are famously small. The amount of gain in drag performance is minimal or even worse if added because the winglets don't add lift but weight, blades don't have a constant flow and you might get unwanted forces at all the different speeds and maneuvering changes helicopters and the blades can do, the blades aren't nearly as rigid as an airplane wing. Also not sure about the aspect ratio of the blades for helicopters, but I assume the aspect ratio has something to do with it as well. I think most passenger planes would prefer to have longer wings tapering out for drag, but since those passenger planes have to fit into parking spots at airports, the winglets are the best next thing for the limit in wing span. Lastly, I am not sure about this, but you want the vortices to move outwards in a helicopter because the next blade might interact with it, and winglets might actually keep the vortices more stable and closer and more likely to interact with the next blade in rotation. Lastly, it has probably been done or theorized anyway. They just are only useful in specific situations like they are for passenger planes. The most optimized shape might actually be related to a humpback whale fins and their leading edges. But it is just way too expensive to make something complicated, different and unproven without enough pressure to do so. And it just costs more to implement than you save in fuel or performance."

They\u2019re usually accurate to fraction of thousandth of an inch. Depending on platen stiffness, load involved, and accuracy you desire, you would some times run a calibration curve first to record machine deflection at the test load range, then subtract that out from your gasket compression data. You can easily find someone to obtain this for you, rather than building your own test rig, if you don\u2019t foresee a need to obtain the data on a regular basis. Either AMTEC or one of the main flange gasket manufacturers can provide this service to you. It might be tricky if your gasket OD is larger than say 12 inches or require more than 500,000 lbf of test load.",

      "output": [
        "*Edit: some* Other answers here are wrong I\u2019m afraid. Hydrofoils are not inherently stable. Even if you have multiple foils they do not naturally self level in pitch or roll. There are various ways to address this. The traditional approach was to use surface piercing foils; the foil is at an angle such that the total amount of foil (and so amount of lift generated) varies as the foil moves up and down. In this way at a given speed the foil will be stable about a certain position. Multiple surface piercing foils gives you stability. The problem is that these foils are draggy and can ventilate (pull air down from the surface on the low pressure side). Another approach is to have a float linked to a trim tab. This is done on the moth dinghy to give ride height control, in concert with a human operated trim tab on the rudder foil. Sideways balance is achieved through skilful adjustment of sails and bodyweight. Instead of a direct mechanical coupling an electronic control system could be used. The Americas Cup boats have a very neat solution invented by the Kiwis called an uptip foil. This has a vertical portion that resists leeway and a near horizontal portion that provides lift. The trick is that this near horizontal portion is angled, such that as leeway changes the angle of attack on the foil changes. As the boat rises less of the vertical portion is in the water so leeway increases, reducing lift on the foil.",
        "Earlier foils (like the US Navy Pegasus) relied on active stabilization, adjusting the angle the \"wing\" was going through the water. Modern mono-hull based foils are still active to some extent but they also seem to have the foils projecting out to the sides more so they act like a tripod for some stability. Then you have foiling power catamarans (like the Hysu-cat from Bering, Insetta 35ifc and the Aquila 36). These foils aren't intended to lift the hulls completely out of the water, only about 75% of the normal wetted surface to reduce drag. They are also entirely passive, no moving parts. The main lifting surface is a shallow \"V\" shape forward of the boats fore-aft center of gravity. There are two small \"winglets\" angled slightly downward just forward of the transom area in the tunnel of the hulls.",
        "The key thing to recognize with stable hydrofoils is that their center of lift *moves* as soon as they change attitude. This is true for lots of ships too\u2026you\u2019re still stable if your center of buoyancy is below your center of gravity (e.g. paddle boards) as long as your center of buoyancy moves enough when you are displaced to create a restoring torque.",
        "Hydrofoil craft are stable the same way that a chair is. Yes the center of gravity is above the center of lift, but the over turning moment is small enough that the system\u2019s stability isn\u2019t impacted. How you accomplish this is very dependent on the type of boat. America\u2019s Cup foiling monohull do this by putting the foil to leeward and using the weight of the boat to counter the overturning moment. Monohull can use different techniques, but a common one is to use foils where the shape of the foil automatically creates additional righting moment as the boat heels over."

        "Depends where you are: if you're in a country town with only one light, it's definitely just a timer. Nothing fancy. Then, as more intersections interact, the systems get more complicated. The most commonly used input is a weight sensor at the stop point for the light. You can often see a rectangle where the asphalt has been cut up to install these sensors. But if you're often pulling up to a light and it just turns red, think about the flow of traffic through the city and which direction most people are going. Traffic light systems are designed to work together to move as much traffic through as efficiently as possible. So if that means timing a series of lights to turn green one after the other as people drive through, that's what they'll do. And if you're driving in the other direction you'll get the opposite - a bunch of unfortunate reds."

Slowing down and turning: accelerating rearward and toward the center of the turn. Newton says you must apply a force to a thing to change its state or it will keep doing what it\u2019s doing. The force in all 4 of these cases causes acceleration in the direction things are changing (into a turn, fwd to speed up, and rearward to slow down). Edit: added some punctuation because mobile sucks.",
        "Newton's first law: An object at rest remains at rest, or if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force. Since velocity is directional, turning requires a change in velocity, which can only occur with the action of an external force. And as per newton's second law, F = ma, the acceleration experienced will be a function of the mass of the object and the force applied. What's really intriguing to think about is that even know a force can accelerate an object, it can do so without increasing of decreasing the energy of that system. Consider a ball tied to a string rotating around a point. The string acts on the ball to make it turn, but doesn't add or remove energy as the force is always completely perpendicular to the motion. Work done = force x distance, since the distance doesn't change, no work is done on the system. Yet still the effect of the force causes an acceleration of the ball!",
        "Straight line getting slower: still accelerating, just in the opposite direction now. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cbraking\u201d in physics, what\u2019s happening is you are accelerating in the opposite direction until you come to a stop Round a corner going faster: still accelerating, just now additionally accelerating in a direction too. I believe it\u2019s called a vector in physics, and it describes how fast and where you are accelerating. This will make more sense as you read on. Round a corner getting slower: still accelerating in the opposite direction just like in the first example, but also accelerating in a direction like the second example Round a corner at constant speed: *still* accelerating, but now you\u2019re only accelerating in the direction of the turn, but no acceleration forwards or backwards relative to the car. This is oversimplifying it, because you\u2019ll notice if you go around a corner giving your car a constant amount of gas, your car will actually slow down slightly. This is because some of the energy is being used to change the direction of the vehicle, hence the acceleration in that direction. Speed is your rate of movement, ie 40 mph. Velocity is your rate of movement plus your direction, ie 40 mph heading northeast. Acceleration is the rate of change in your velocity, so any change in speed *or* direction is acceleration. Basically any time you are not moving at a constant speed in a constant direction, you are accelerating. Going down a road at 40 mph, no acceleration. Speed up or slow down, acceleration. Change direction at all, anything other than straight ahead, acceleration.",
        "A physicist would say all of these cases describe acceleration. If you consider your movement not simply as speed (the thing on the dashboard dial) but velocity (which is speed with a direction - a vector quantity), then any change to speed and/or direction represents a change in velocity. Change in velocity is acceleration."

To imagine how this works, think of one fan blowing air and causing another fan's blades to turn. The difference is that the transmission fluid is also under pressure.

        "Electricity does NOT take the shortest path to ground. It takes ALL paths to ground with the current divided between the conductors based on the resistance of each path. If they (grounds and neutrals) are connected together at the sub panel then the current that is flowing in the hot leg will be divided to flow back to the main panel along both the neutral and the ground wires... based on the resistance of each path. Normally, when correctly wired (no connection in the sub panel) all current will flow back to the main panel along only the neutral wire. The confusion is often because the ground and neutral conductors are still connected at the main. When wired correctly no current can flow through the ground conductor to the sub panel because there is no potential difference between the ends of that wire. In fact, if the sub panel is in an out building there should also be a ground rod for the sub panel further guaranteeing no potential difference between the panels along the ground conductor. The reason this is done is because the ground is also connected to the metal cases of appliances/devices. If there is current flowing on the ground conductor then these metal cases are energized and potentially dangerous.",
        "Your sub panel is grounded in your main panel. This allows the use of the main grounding system. Article 250.32 deals with feeders supplying a seperate ground rod for the new building. Please read that section as I don't think I am explaining well. As far as neutrals and grounds being cross-connected.....again, parallel paths are created which can mess with many different items.....gfci's are an easy one to see. Also remember that the grounds connect to equipment external metal parts. Cross-connecting grounds and neutrals means equipment metal external parts are at neutral potential, not ground potential. A \"Hot Neitral\" situation can now put 120 vac on the external metal parts of stuff like toaster ovens. Not every crossed neutral-ground condition fits into your scenario, however, it is easy to see how important this is."
