They want someone who doesn't blatantly copy another well respected homie. Now, I would advice you against deciding to blend in. This can easily backfire on you just like being yourself could backfire. But at least if you are being yourself you don't have to feel exhausted after the party since you weren't pretending to be some you are not. There really is no way to be cool unless if you have experience with how guys around you think being cool is. There are so many differing opinions on how to be cool and I'ma tell you rn that a very common opinion amongst many people, myself included is \"it's not cool to want to be cool\". Just be who you are and if they find it cool, then cool, it doesn't matter and you shouldn't be striving for that. Just enjoy your time their instead of trying so hard to be liked. They will very easily see that you are trying to make them like you and they will not like that. Relax and do whatever feels natural.

        "girl, i got you. I was in the same boat when i was a frosh. First, you're gonna need 3 key staples in a teen girl's routine in this day and age: Concealer, an eyelash curler, and a good mascara. a good concealer when youre just starting is the elf camo concealer. apply on your undereyes and on any blemishes or pimples! next, eyelash curler, if you are confused by it i would recommend watching a tiktok or youtube vid. next, mascara. some good ones (in my opinion) are loreal telescopic, covergirl lash blast, and maybelline sky high. Make sure that if you are blonde you use a brown mascara, otherwise black should be a good shade for you. Thats all! if you want to do more, eyebrow gel (i like the nyx brow glue or the clear maybelline mascara as a brow gel) and a highlighter is good (any drugstore highlighter, depending on your skin tone, eyecolor, and hair color the color of highlighter you want will very).",
        "Here's the kid whose mom used to work for Mary Kay. First, you want to start out simple with things that aren't super hard to mess up. Plus it will be a little weird for other people to see you without makeup all your life and then suddenly out of the blue you have a full face of makeup. I started with concealer, foundation, and eyeliner. You should wash your face first to get any dry skin off, and put on moisturizer. For concealer, a dot is a lot. You put a little bit on any spots on your face you don't want people to see. You put it on before the foundation but you have to do the foundation quickly after so that the concealer doesn't dry. Don't rub in the concealer. It's not quite as important if concealer matches your skin tone, but foundation needs to be as close as possible. It looks so weird when a person's face is a different shade from their neck and arms. When applying foundation, put a little bit on one of your middle fingers, then rub it with the middle finger on your opposite hand. Then dab it on your face. Two finger pads on your forehead, one on each temple, one on either side of your nose, and two on your chin (you can do two on your chin because by then the foundation on your fingers is mostly gone). If you have a little extra, put it on either your cheeks or neck. You will need a foundation brush or one of those foam triangles you can get in like a 50 pack. Just spread the foundation across your face, making sure it's even, no streaks or anything. Get up to your hair line, send a brush over your ears, and also brush down your neck to make any different tones look natural. For simple eyeliner, you'll just need an eyeliner pencil. You stretch out the lid of your eye until it's flat and start drawing. You want the eyeliner to be as close to or on the base of your eyelashes as possible. You want the shape to look something like this (excuse my crude tracing): It's a little hard to not flutter your eye while doing it, but try not to. With practice your eyelid will stop moving and your eyeliner will be less squiggly. Once you've done these things for a while you can message me for how to do the other aspects of makeup. You'll want to add them in one by one so that it's more of a transition to a full face of makeup and you get good practice.",
        "start with simple looks first. foundation, blush, and mascara. maybe eyeliner if you're feeling up to the challenge. then you can move onto bronzers, eyeshadow, contours, highlights, whatever else. if you don't have any female role models that could help, then simple YT tutorials for beginners will help. maybe search up things directed at tweens (I know you're not one, but that's when a lot of girls first start getting into makeup. i imagine there'll be something for you.)",
        "ive been doing makeup since i was 13. i still kinda suck at it but i\u2019m getting better. i would recommend just starting with mascara, eyeliner and maybe some lip gloss at first. start light and don\u2019t expect it to look that good at first bc it won\u2019t. it takes practice for mascara it probably doesnt matter that much which one you use at first tbh. i like this one personally eyelash curlers also make a big difference. they can make your eyes stand out way more and look really good, but you dont need to use it at first tho if you dont want for eyeliner, i think its a lot easier to work with liquid eyeliner (idk why but i cannot for the life of me get a pencil eyeliner to look good). i use this one i mostly just use it on my upper waterline and/or along the top eyelid, as close to the lashes as i can, and do a small wing. i never put it on the bottom of my eye at all bc i feel like it makes my eyes look smaller and \u201cmore mature\u201d, but if your going for that look then maybe you might like doing it that way for things like lip gloss and blush if you use it, use more natural colours at first. i\u2019m really light skinned so i usually use a light pink lip gloss or honestly even an almost clear one. i like this one in 105 petal and 870 frosted (this obviously might be different for you if youre a different skin tone/lip colour/undertone than me) i really wouldnt worry about foundation and stuff like that rn. like honestly it is such a pain to try to find the right shade and undertone and stuff and trying to get it to match perfectly and half the brands you find literally don\u2019t even make a colour light enough for your skin tone, and then you also have to get the right type of finish and the right level of coverage and then you have to make sure that you use compatible moisturisers and sunscreens or else it will look cakey and separate (if you cant tell i have been struggling a lot with foundation lately lmao). a good skincare routine and daily spf is way more important than foundation anyway imo"

My ex was 5'9'10 and I've seen groups of big dudes look concerned but turn their backs. It's called deferred responsibility and it's a problematic mindset. &#x200B; YOu can always call security or the police on the non-ermegency line and this is also a way of intervening whilst keeping yourselves safe. &#x200B; I'd like to ask why you didn't call the police?

Also, unless you are absolutely smashing yourself every work out, 30 minutes is enough. 2 upper, 2 lower body and an accessory or two. No need to rest 3 minutes.

I do a full body routine (a mix of calisthenics and dumbbell exercises) three days a week followed by a half hour of heavy cardio every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 4pm, light cardio every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:30pm, and either walk at least five miles or bike twenty miles over a two-day weekend.",

The biggest challenge is when they are young and need a lot of supervision, but not all sports need to be very hands on. Running can be done any place, any day, any time, with anyone you want....assuming you can get the kids to go with you. Then there's the fact that you can't focus on just yourself during the workout, but it's a trade-off for having something that's \"our thing\". Other parents I know workout during lunch and eat at their desk while they work. Some wake up early. Some workout at home with the kids nearby or in another room.

If you're over 40, I'll further argue cardiovascular health is more important than big gains. Focus on moving (run/walk/bike) and mix in bodyweight exercises.

While the above is not much, I\u2019ve been able to keep it consistent because it\u2019s so quick & simple. You don\u2019t need to go to a gym or do an hour long workout. At a gym most people spend more time standing around in between sets than doing actual weights. I haven\u2019t been in a gym in almost 10 years and I have a better body than anyone I know, if I\u2019m being honest, and I\u2019m 47. I\u2019ve got adjustable barbells where I can add or remove plates, so that helps for the biceps & shoulders, as my shoulders can\u2019t handle as much weight as my biceps. For legs, I do 5 sets of 5 reps of calf raises while I clean my teeth. And I do 2 sets of 50 reps of squats (just body weight - no barbell) for my quads/thighs after dinner to burn off some glucose. For cardio, we have a treadmill, so I run 3+ miles first every Saturday morning, and on Sundays I do 20+ minutes on our Peloton. Each minute I alternate between resistance at 40 and 80. The high/hard resistance gives my legs more of a work out. I walk as much as I can on my lunch break, and use a standing desk for about an hour a day. I\u2019ve read that a short HIIT workout can deliver as much benefits as a longer, steady workout. I also do a run or use the Peloton on my lunch break when I work from home on Mondays and Fridays, although I realize not everyone has that luxury. The key is to start small and know that daily consistency/habit is more importantly than the actual length/intensity of the workout, until you\u2019re able to form a consistent routine. There are some apps that give you a 7 or 8 minute workout. If you\u2019re short on time, I\u2019d consider doing those. It\u2019s always better than nothing. Best of luck!",
        "im lucky in that im a freelancer so can largely pick my hours. but i still make a habit to go right after i drop the kid at school, and work back in the evening. Ive tried just check the morning mail then go, it rarely works. having it fixed in the schedule and working around it is important, as is forgiving yourself when life gets in the way. you just get back in the rhythym with the next session Ive also limited myself to twice a week with a full body workout. Im still making gains at 50, i have time to recover between sessions and Im always keen for that next session. Also saves on the extra time around driving there, changing etc compared to more but shorter sessions"

        "I have extremely heavy and painful periods. Two things have helped me. One is taking a birth control pill. The other is drinking a quart of red raspberry leaf tea between periods. I was very skeptical about the latter recommendation, but my friend asked what I had to lose by trying it. So I did. I was very surprised to find it worked really well for me. I took several years in talking to a doctor to find out what was wrong with no answers. 15 years later I found out I have fibroids which can cause heavy bleeding. Best of luck to you.",
        "I just found out I have endometriosis. Probably an advanced stage. It\u2019s hell. When you say painful I truly hope it\u2019s not debilitating agonizing pain because if it is then you need to start by speaking to your gynecologist. Otherwise, my heating pad is my closest friend at this point. NSAIDs can help but use with caution, personally they\u2019ve really messed up my stomach. I started using a castor oil pack on my abdomen most nights and it is significantly decreasing my pain. You can\u2019t use it while you\u2019re on your period but outside of that it\u2019s extremely relaxing. Yoga videos for pms/cramping on YouTube are really helpful as well. Anything you can do to perform self care is good. Chamomile tea is very soothing. Lots of women swear by THC and I\u2019ll agree it helps significantly with pain but I personally can\u2019t handle the anxiety is causes for me so I\u2019ve taken a break from it.",

She\u2019s been behaving erratically and saying crazy, unacceptable stuff.

If it was a manager, then it depends on how big of an operation it is. Small family-owned? Get out. Find a new job. Large corporate?

Coming from experience I've had plenty of old heads with a chip on their shoulder either have no clue what to do with this response or they actually open up about some stuff.

        "#Document Everything Unfortunately, the reality of the business world in 2024 is that HR cases are massively stacked against you in a \"his word against hers\" case. You will have to do your part and politely remind her that you don't appreciate all those comments. But most HR departments are going to tread pretty lightly in any \"Him vs Her\" claims, you will lose all of those. So you need numbers, dates, and quotes. Just create an email addressed to yourself, Cc your private email. Simply document word for word what she said, what it was in response to, the exact minute that it was said. Save it, once a month or once week send it to yourself to back it up. Over time, you'll have enough to bring to your boss and HR. You will have to have proof that you at least tried to address it with her first, otherwise your case is gone. And you'll have specifics that you're not going off memory. As a manager who had to deal with these cases along with HR, I can testify that *every* case in which one person had documented notes on what was said from the time it was said, had a massive advantage over the other person that was going off memory of days, weeks, or months ago.",

Our back and forth banter can be VERY course... Especially if you're fucking up, which costs us pay (we also get a production bonus that can go as high as $30-40/hr on top of our hourly pay). If getting insulted, yelled at, or crude remarks hurt your feelings, then it's probably not a job that you want. As far as handling it, words have never bothered me. I've done it for 24 years and, to me, it's just normal conversation. The men do it, the women do it, and in most jobs some would call it sexual harassment with some of the shit we say but, at the same time, we know that we have each other's backs... Working. 12 hour a day together, in our type of work bonds you in strange ways. Last April I killed a coworker. It was an accident, I was released of all fault by the sheriff's dept, the company, and OSHA. I was off work for a week after (they closed the mill for 3 days and I had my normal 4 days off after that) and, while I was off work, I had a hundred of those men and women that don't hesitate to call you a piece of shit at work, calling me, texting me, and coming by my house to check in me and make sure that I was ok. That's just the way we are, we look out for each other... All the rude, crude banter just eases the job stress. I know that isn't your situation but, you just have to take rude motherfuckers in stride. It's more about them, than you. However, if it bothers you that much, go to HR, with it. Besides quitting, that's about the best you can do to stop it",

That way you'll always be able to 1UP her i.e. remember when you gave me head, I hadn't showered that day and I fight crime in a rubber suit, really seals in the flavour.. On a more serious note, just tell her casually to cool it with the insults cause it's not really your thing. She should take the hint and if she doesn't, just go to your immediate and let them know about it then go from there. Let us know how you go."

There may have been a time where you wanted something, you didn't get it no matter how much you prepared or how hard you tried. It's just the way life is. I think that the belief that we will all find our \"other half\", or that good things come to those who wait, or that life rewards merit or hard work is a bit false. There are many things that you can't control. You could even get married to the love of your life next year, and then a year later you lose them in an accident. I know multiple people who were happily married until their spouse passed from illness at a young age, or accident, or the \"love of their life\" turned out to have more than one \"love of their life\" and they got divorced. I know people who have no children by choice, no children not by choice, or have children that they don't like who also hate each other. I know people who have had greatly wanted children that they paid money through IVF for, and the child has multiple learning difficulties and mental health issues because... life.

I\u2019m 34 now and 100% sure I actually don\u2019t want the responsibility of children. Life basically opened up and felt good again once I took the pressure off.

I've been single for almost 12 years now, and not by choice, and not in spite of trying very hard. It just never worked out. Just like you I had built the life I wanted and was constantly waiting for THE GUY to come into my life. But he never did. I started therapy and my goal was exactly what you said, how do you accept you may never get married? How do you accept to (likely) wake up single every day of your life? I had barely started therapy, then I became severely sick. I lost everything (work, friends, housing, etc) including my autonomy so I had to move back to my mom's. It has been almost 3 years now and my prognosis is unclear. I have been so sick and unable to function that I am not thinking anymore about finding a man. But if I stay like this it will likely never happen anyway. I don't have a miracle solution for coming to terms with that. I don't think anything can replace having a relationship. I have believed for a long time in the myth of the ''strong and independent woman'' but I call it bullshit now. I think being in a (healthy) relationship is a basic emotional need for most adult people. I think the only think we can do is grieve everyday and try to focus on the things that bring us joy and not give up on dating. I am sorry that this is not an uplifting comment. But this is how I am going through this experience.",

I had kids somewhat later (39) after losses and lots of treatments, so I had a lot of thinking time on what I'd do if it didn't happen. Where I landed was, I could redefine what Family looked like for me. You can do the same. Maybe you have kids by yourself now. You can get reasonable loans for fertility treatments (assuming you want that for genetic testing or counseling?) that are equivalent to buying a car in regards to payments. If you don't need screening of your eggs, you can do things much cheaper with donor sperm... but talk to your doctor about what options work for your situation. Maybe you adopt, though that's also very expensive and fraught with challenges of its own. Don't let anyone tell you either that it's criminal or that it's the only ethical choice for fertimity challenged folks. It's its own whole situation. Maybe you get really active in volunteering with disadvantaged kids to fill your nurturing need. You wouldn't have a child at home, but you could interact and mentor tons. Maybe you teach girls with cf how to tell folks to eff off and stop telling them what to do. You can't make a guy magically appear to suit your needs. You can choose your own path to family. Approach it as you do limitations from your disability- like, ok, I can't do everything the way I'd rather. That's a bummer reality and it's not being defeatist to be mad or disappointed about it.

Or just stop paying into my retirement and blow it all on crazy experiences. Part of me struggles to give up hope, but financially it's not likely for me to be able to do it on my own.

Life always works out in mysterious ways. But don\u2019t ever lose hope or let go of your dream. It can still happen in multiple ways. I\u2019m saying this as someone who always wanted to be a mother and have a family of my own. I\u2019ve been looking for a partner for 8 years and I\u2019m still very single now at soon 34.

You deserve this beautiful dream of yours. Get out there. Live your best life. Be happy. Smile at random people. Know that good things are coming and life will work out only for the best.

I have female cousins who had kids in their 40's (one of them just had a baby at 46), and neither of them got married until after their mid 30's (ie. 37 & 39).

I fostered a friend\u2019s toddler for a few months and I felt like it was going to literally kill me even though he\u2019s a great kiddo. It still stings, I wish I could handle it - but I try to focus on what that frees up space for in my life and celebrate how much better this choice is in the day to day.

I\u2019m reasonably attractive, educated, financially secure, interesting, intelligent\u2026 but there\u2019s a lot of bad male behavior I won\u2019t tolerate. I see the relationships around me and I wouldn\u2019t want to be in most of them. When I turne 30 and was single I realized, statistically, I would probably never get married. Anyway for me it was a matter of like having an intention - to give up - and during my last relationship (ended a couple years ago) I had the sense that if it didn\u2019t work with him, I would just be done. I would give up. When we broke up, the shift finally happened. The hope was dead. I have dated a little since then - I still *want* a partner even tho I have no hope about it - and it is so much easier now because there is just no investment or hope going into it. It takes much much less of my energy. And decisions like should I look for a new job, should I buy a condo, etc, are easier because I\u2019m not like well what if I meet someone and my condo is too small for both of us etc\u2026 I can stop planning with a question mark . The other thing is to work on building a life that is meaningful to you whether or not you ever have a partner\u2026 could be through your career, volunteering, creative pursuits, etc. I mentor young people at my job. That expresses the same part of me as parenting and is meaningful to me.",
        "The key to happiness is non-attachment. When you are attached to a certain outcome or to a person behaving a certain way to be happy, you give away your power. I would try to focus on all the advantages of being single and childless. We seem to always think that life will be better on a different path, but then you read the MANY MISERABLE stories of married women on this sub and regretful parents. These women all assumed they would be happier being married and having children and now they are miserable. I don\u2019t have an illness like yours, but I\u2019ve had many disappointing experiences with men. I\u2019m convinced they only want you if you can take them or leave them. So basically I can have a good relationship with a guy if I feel like I don\u2019t need him and could be just fine without him. Otherwise he disappears just like your guy did. That\u2019s not what I want so I\u2019ve given up on men and am just focusing on finding happiness in the present moments. We have so much to be grateful for. Watch the news about the Gaza air drops and realize how lucky we are to have all the food we need.",
        "I was single for seven years and spent a lot of time working on myself..saving money, going back to school, started a non profit and a business and bought a house. I had dated a lot of people who just never were where I was-they were dishonest with me (and ultimately themselves), they were selfish, the list goes on. I have an \u2018invisible\u2019 disability, like you can\u2019t tell physically but when you\u2019re around me long enough you will know. I had thought it was how I was, but I honestly did a lot of healing and told myself I\u2019d be completely fine being single because other people don\u2019t measure my worth and a lot of people don\u2019t ever take the time to heal from their own traumas and project it onto others. I had a lot of grief of not being able to be close to kids as I got older and am not close to family so there was a lot of dread. But it went away the more I worked on myself. I went to a native ceremony one day and ended up meeting my husband. I definitely was not there looking for someone. It was a huge blessing, we are not married and I am pregnant! I would say that finding people who you feel safe and grounded with in your community helps too. Whatever way your life ends up you are totally worth all the care and love.",
        "I'm going to chime in here and say that in terms of the quality of men, we're in a really difficult time to try and find a long term partner. No that there isn't a lot of men - it's easier to *meet* lots of men than ever before, and to have sex with them. But a quality relationship? I think once men realised they could \"get\" sex from women without any long term commitment, a lot of them collectively decided that's all we're good for. Not mention how many of them are watching increasingly violent and degrading porn. Plus women are increasingly realising that while our gender has gone into the workforce en masse, a lot of men still expect their female partner to do the majority of the childrearing and domestic labour. Be careful what you wish for. The shittiest relationships I ever had were the ones in my late 30s when I thought I \"should\" be with a man because that's what everyone around me was doing.",
        "I didn\u2019t find my partner until 35 and then things happened FAST. You may never get married. Is it marriage that you want? Or what does marriage represent to you? A steady person? Companionship? Love? Fill in the blank here. This is going to sound super cheesy but I used to say things like, \u201cI just want love!\u201d And I spent so much time focusing on this very specific thing that I *didnt* have that I would miss all the ways and forms it was actually coming to me. I was getting love from family, friends, the barista that hooked me up with the free coffee, the people giving me smiles every day. I also started to really celebrate love that I loved. I met some men that would speak soooo highly of their partner. One said, \u201cI love how smart she is. She\u2019s always reading and learning. She\u2019s amazing\u201d And i thought \u201cthat\u2019s how I want my partner to talk about me\u201d and I really thought something like that is worth waiting for. I\u2019ve met so many people that found love much later in life (mid 50s!) and I just thought \u201chmm. Maybe I\u2019ll be one of them\u201d but I didn\u2019t want to put my life on hold in the meantime. Yes, things felt time sensitive with children etc. but ultimately\u2026 tomorrow is never promised. So it\u2019s really just about enjoying right now and making them moment you can and building your own happiness NOW. I know sometimes all this talk doesn\u2019t help when you\u2019re really yearning, but it did help me accept that I am not in charge of the timeline of my life all the time.

For quite a few, the reality was worse than they ever could have imagined (i.e. their spouse was abusive, their child or spouse died young, their spouse sexually abused their own child, etc) It\u2019s very hard to grieve the loss of the ideal. But keep in mind that what you are imagining IS an ideal. All you know is the wonderful parts that you imagine you would have had. But you don\u2019t know whether any of those would have happened even if you did marry and have kids. And you don\u2019t know how much pain or difficulty you also would have experienced along the way. At the end of the day, no one\u2019s life goes exactly how they want it to.

Been seeing someone for a few months, and it's been okay. But when I think about my future I just see myself and I'm trying to be okay with that. Focusing on my friends, family, and my hobbies. Focusing on my career. Does your insurance cover IVF and can you do it alone? Like is ot possible if you wanted to do it with a donor this year or maybe next year? Have you looked into adopting? Maybe just look onto other possibilities and see what's plausible. I don't think you have to give up on that yet."

If you don't know what you're doing, find someone who does. When I got my first job I took a non-credit class at a community college to learn the ins and outs of investing and found my financial advisor there (he taught the class). I've been working with him ever since. I listen to him and he does advise me, but I have also made sure that I understand what he suggests to me and I do my own research too. Finally - ***you do not need to make a lot of money to save and invest***. Every penny counts. When I connected with my financial advisor when I got my first job in my 20s, I made $26,000 a year. I still saved and invested. Sometimes my monthly contribution was very very tiny, but I stuck with it and over the years and as I earned more I saved more and invested more.

Add up how much you fill up each time and then they need to pay you that cost, if it's multiple people then divide by those, do not include yourself. If people buy you a drink or food etc appreciate the gesture but explain that it shouldn't be subtracted from the gas, and that you consider those types of things as a gift, if they cannot gift you, it's fine. If you have other people who can drive or are willing to drive then just divide the hours up as evenly as possible, like if you are doing 6hr drive one way, 2hrs for each of the drivers (if 3 drivers), or 3hrs each for two drivers. If there's other people who have cars that can offer to share the burden of trips then split the trips as such, like one trip it's you, next trip it's Bonnie, and basically rotate and keep track, and keep track if anyone says they have car trouble etc and notes on what was said etc just in case...people can lie unfortunately. Anyway this is what I could come up with. I've never really had this type of issue, but if I get a ride from a friend when I really needed the favor, I will always send them some $ through cash app or one of those apps for gas money.

And she always asked. It was a long time before I realized that she didn't actually know the difference - she couldn't tell that my clothes were cheap (because I have taste and I don't buy things that are i\u013al fitting).

I found purpose and happiness in God. He made us the way we are and by knowing and following Him I was fulfilled. First I accepted Him as my savior: John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Then I found that serving Him by working to turn around troubled teens in a local juvenile detention center was what I was truly made to do. That makes me not only happy, but joyful. You have a purpose and God can show you what He made you to do too! Think about it- when you are 80 years old looking back on your life, what will you view as most meaningful? You will never hear someone say \u201cI wish I spent more time at the office\u201d, or \u201cmade more money\u201d, or even more time partying\u201d.

        "Children watching television was *very* dangerous. You would go square-eyed! \"Screen time\" (everything) was limited to 20 minutes per day for anyone under 18. Total. Even in the 80's. Although this rule could also be blown through, any time that parents said so. In the early days of television in the UK, broadcasts were strictly limited in length, because scientists were certain that anything longer would drive people insane. Simpler shows such as \"the potter's wheel\", or a repetitive display of a man and horse ploughing a field, were used to fill in some parts of the broadcast window, as these were felt to be less dangerous. The same type of people, had proved in previous ages that travelling at more than 15 miles per hour would cause irreparable brain damage. The same type of people in our current age, are convinced that access to iPads is doing irreparable damage to all children right now. And they're right! Not long to save them!

The Christians thought they were the \"mark of the beast\" and Hobby Lobby is still against bar codes. They say it's for other reasons but it's nonsensical to refuse bar codes for the reason given, that they just want to give a more \"human approach\" which ends up being more problems for their workers. The truth is more likely they're still promoting the idea that bar codes are the beast. Edit: Someone messaged to tell me this was debunked but I'm debunking the debunker and saying the owner SAYS this isn't the reason, and made a list of reasons why they did it, none of which make sense financially or as far as customer service goes and especially \"makes the cashier feel more in control\" isn't remotely true. In fact they have to remember a whole lot more and they tend to, you know, NOT. So they have a big problem with prices on the receipt being wrong especially when it comes to big sales when they have to remember every brand and product on sale at the time. My best friend who has worked as an executive assistant for several powerful CEOs in the region said the job she held at Hobby Lobby in customer service was the worst clusterfuck she ever saw. And she said she doesn't care what they say, that they are not even ALLOWED to discuss bar code systems in the presence of management."

        "I was just a kid, but even I was aware of a lot of social turmoil in the mid to late 1960s and early 1970s. It was a chaotic time in the U.S. -- even more so than today. Leaders were getting assassinated. Then in the 1970s to early 1980s stagflation hit the U.S. hard. If you think inflation is a problem now, it was much worse then. From 1970-1981 -- an eleven year period -- the average inflation rate in the United States was nearly 8% per year. In that period there were four recessions. That said, both my parents had good jobs and education was much more affordable back then, so it didn't hit me personally much. But I was very aware of it. Everything you might have heard about kids wandering the neighborhood unsupervised is true. And we had no cell phones. I enjoyed my freedom. That said, there's a lot to be said for adult-supervised activities. Lots of bored kids got in trouble back then. The danger of being kidnapped was greatly overblown, but it did happen sometimes. I had a friend who was kidnapped on her way home from school, then raped and murdered. It was awful. But then, bad things still happen from time to time. It's impossible to protect kids from everything. I worry about my daughters, but I can't confine them to the house, either. I just have to hope nothing bad happens to them.",
        "I lived in a US, middle class, predominantly white suburb during the second half of the 1970s as an elementary school girl. Things that stand out: (1) I was very aware of the feminist movement and it shaped my thinking but it had not reached my world. The mothers generally stayed home with the children and deferred to the fathers. We constantly received messages from parents, teachers, television, and other sources that \"boys rule and girls drool.\" I particularly remember a female gym teacher dividing our class into 5 teams - all with a male captain and a female second-in-command. My complaint about this was met with bafflement.  (2) Watching television was a very different experience. There were only a few channels and I well remember being bored and not being able to find anything that I would want to watch. Somehow there were constantly re-runs of \"The Birds\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" But when there was a show that I liked, EVERYONE from my school would watch it and talk about it the next day (like the most recent \"Brady Bunch\" re-run).  Also there was no way to record anything, so if I were out and about with my parents, I would often be extremely anxious about getting home in time to watch a particular show - like \"The Muppet Show\" on Saturday night or \"The Wizard of Oz\" once a year. (3) The Iran Hostage Crisis dominated the news for over a year. There were yellow ribbons tied around trees everywhere as a symbol of support for the hostages. People were consumed with anger and hatred towards the hostage takers and the Ayatollah Khomeini. I remember the boys in my elementary school taking over a jungle gym and yelling chants in unison against the Ayatollah, which struck me as incredibly silly at the time. But I do not recall that these feelings translated into the same degree of Islamophobia that we saw after 9/11 and today. My class had an Iranian boy whose parents had fled Iran and he was welcomed and well-liked. (4) Children whose parents made them wear helmets when riding a bicycle were considered weird. (5) We were all obsessed with Star Wars.",
        "I was born in the late 1960s and have a lot of memories and awareness starting in the lower grades around 1975.  I was brought up in small town America in the midwestern US.  Below is a description of bucolic small town midwestern life 1975-1980. At least in my little town in the midwest, there were a lot of economic problems. Inflation, higher gas prices, higher food prices.  Gasoline prices are a major indicator of economic health.  My earliest memory of gasoline prices was 65 cents a gallon. I remember it jumping to around 90 cents at some point before 1980, and my dad getting so pissed about it. Inflation was very, very bad around that time - at the end of Ford's presidency and the beginning of Carter's presidency. There was high distrust of government - the US was reeling from the Watergate scandal and Nixon's resignation, Ford's borderline incompetence, and Carter's election mainly as a direct response to Watergate. Internationally I was aware of unrest in the Middle East. The Shah of Iran was overthrown and the US embassy overrun and hostages taken. Ronald Reagan probably owed his presidency to that hostage crisis and Carter's complete ineptitude in handling it. That crisis was the first time most people in the US had ever really heard or learned anything about Islam other than what they had learned in school.  Christianity was dominant politically, ideologically, and socially in the US, much, much more than it is now. Overall there was a lot of distrust and unhappiness. As a kid: you ran around unsupervised with other kids because there was literally nothing else to do. Most of the time there was nothing on TV to watch. If you wanted to listen to music you had your own vinyl LPs or cassette tapes, or the radio. Information was limited to what you could find out from your parents, or friends, or newspapers, or TV/radio. Information on anything, and access to/analysis of that information, was much, much more limited, controlled, and circumscribed than it is now.  The way you learned about girls was you listened to your dad or men in your family or if you were lucky, older brothers or older boys.  I grew up in the era of complete bullshit education on this, of \"girls love nice guys\" and \"looks don't matter\" and \"we just want nice guys who treat us right\".  There was no emphasis on making sure you looked your best and didn't put up with crap from girls. Socially:  There was a lot of thinly veiled racism, sexism, and homophobia. You had to fit into little boxes everyone had set out for you. If you were nonconformist in any way, you were labeled \"gay\" or \"qu33r\" or \"f@g\".  You were either a popular kid or you were an outcast.  There was no help for you.  Bullying was rampant and everyone, including school and civil authorities, looked the other way.",

        "I grew up in a small, rural Midwestern community; born in the late 1950s. A big change that I've noticed is that people back then didn't talk publicly about religion or politics. Those were issues you kept to yourself. And people respected that. Nobody cared if you were a Republican or a Democrat or if you were Methodist or Presbyterian. You do you. Also, people in general were much more polite to one another. Karens didn't really exist. People didn't act entitled. I think some of this could be because I was from a small, rural Midwestern community, and these things may not apply to people who grew up in New York or LA, for example. I also think part of it is the internet. People are used to expressing their opinions \"publicly\" and they think everyone is interested in hearing what they have to say."

Eventually I took more classes since the people coming to me needed more skills than I had yet.",
        "Nothing grand so there was nothing to find. Show gratitude, appreciation, and help when I can. Allow others to help me, learn from others, and understand criticism from our young people. Leave things better than I find them. Accept that all work is honorable so I show up and be present even in less than desirable situations. Respect people. Protect animals.",
        "Purpose is overrated, IMO. My \"purpose\" is to live a happy life, day by day, without wrecking anyone else's. Having a job, hobbies, etc. are basically in service to this, when all is said and done. Some people are very driven and goal directed, but that's not for me. It's sounds exhausting and likely to lead to the exact opposite of what I strive for.",
        "For many years, I thought it was to be a competition typewriter tuner. There used to be large typing contests across the country (worldwide?) and I had built a solid reputation as being an good mechanic, especially in the fine tuning of competition typewriters. I didn't work for any particular pro, but traveled the competitive circuit, on call to fine tune anyone's typewriter -- if they could afford my services. I got top dollar for my work, which was in the winner's circle more often than not. Well, no need to say what happened to professional competitive typing.",
        "My purpose found me. It\u2019s a long story. My purpose is to serve others in the healthcare field which I have enjoyed. To be a good mother and role model to my child. Show love and kindness and compassion where needed and give out a smile everyday even if I am not feeling it.",
        "I found my purpose as I entered middle age during the pandemic. I got to thinking about everything I\u2019d done before 40 (especially career and volunteer work), and what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I thought about my personal values and beliefs. Then looking at all of this I was able to derive common themes and patterns, and from there found my purpose. I think our purpose is what we want it to be. On a subconscious level we\u2019re working toward whatever it is. And it can change over time. I know it\u2019s cheesy, but be true and honest to yourself and you\u2019ll find it. It\u2019s arbitrary in the grand scheme of things, and is up to us to define it."

        "I'm seeing most comments being about communications, so I had to think a minute for something else. Washing machines. I remember the wringer washers of my childhood, as well as those small washer-spinner things, then the ones most of us are familiar with-- knobs and dials and an agitator. Mine is slightly newer-- 8-10 years old-- and is all touch button, beeps (except a couple weeks ago it went mute and I haven't looked into it yet), and no freaking agitator! Nothing to fetch bra straps or panties on, which is nice, but my clothes would be cleaner if I beat them on the rocks down at the stream. Most things I can't wash with the water saver setting. I'm going to start looking for an old refurbished machine. I don't need 20 different settings. I just need barn clothes to come out clean.",
        "Definitely cell phones. They were very primitive when they started becoming somewhat common in the late 90s. I don't think you could even text with them most of the time. That's why there were beepers then. It was a miracle when you could actually make a call without having to use the home phone and phone booth, even more of a miracle when you could go on a monthly plan with free nationwide calling and text, and even more of a miracle once you could get on the Internet with smartphones. I grew up not being even able to purchase my own phone; the telephone company had to install it for you, and you couldn't take it out of your home. Starting about 1983-84, when I was in my early 20s, you could start purchasing home phones, and the jacks made it much easier to install the phone yourself in your home. I didn't even have a flip phone until 2001, and I got my first smartphone about 2012.  I had a phone where I could \"partially\" get on the Internet in 2009.",
        "Computers. (obvious I suppose) when I first started using them, the vast majority of computing was local. I used them mostly for writing papers and a bit of database work. if you wanted to reach out and touch someone, your session required a separate device and the session had a definite beginning and end. But now the script is flipped, online is the default state. even apps are getting sucked out to the internet. I used to buy Adobe products and install them to do design work, or buy word processing programs to compose documents. Now they are subscription products, like a magazine or a rental, which I still find utterly weird.",
        "The internet. So much relies on it now and we take it for granted, but it was originally just for nerds doing nerdy stuff. You needed a computer, modems, command line magic (telnet to IP addresses), there was nothing graphical, just the command line. It's incredible how much it has evolved.",
        "Cordless power tools. What started as almost a gimmick with a screwdriver in the 80s has turned the entire industry around. Almost any tool you can think of now has very capable cordless versions. I own a cordless miter saw, circular saw, and leaf blower that are plenty powerful and have long battery lives. The idea of any of these as replacements for corded/gas tools would have been laughed at even 20 years ago.",
        "Phones in general. Started with phones connected to a wall and attached by a long cord that you either stretched out of shape trying to get some privacy or had to walk under when you entered a room, now at the point where you can be in an auditorium full of people and send a message without even talking to them.",
        "Electric cars. When we were younger they were much smaller, no safety equipment, battery power sucked and they only held 2 people and my brother wouldn't let me drive and we faught and mom sent us to our rooms for a time out. It was a good jeep, but my sister drove it down the stairs and it broke."
